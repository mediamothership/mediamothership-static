Speaker 1
There is nothing wrong with your radio.
Speaker
Do not attempt to adjust the volume. We are controlling. For the next hour, we will control all that you hear.
Speaker 1
You are about to experience the knowledge and insights of the media mothership.
Craig
Alright, welcome here to Edge Radio 99.3 FM and this is media mothership. I&rsquo;m your host. Doctor Craig. Oh, we&rsquo;ve got the doctor back. I&rsquo;m feeling pretty confident about winning it. Let&rsquo;s try and pull out any qualifications I have joined by. Do you want to plan any of your qualifications? Magister. Yeah, magister. And that&rsquo;s based on.
Taylor
That&rsquo;s based on the old it. It means master, and so therefore a masters is a magister and you know doctor is a doctor.
Speaker
Ohh.
Craig
Right. And you&rsquo;ve of course you you did a A. Job with. I can remember your honours.
Taylor
Yeah, yeah. And then did a master teaching.
Craig
Master. Yes. Yeah, I&rsquo;m trying to. Remember and I sleep 3. You were masters or something, right? Supervise that all.
Taylor
Right. But actually in in Norway, I think I think it&rsquo;s Norway, they still call a a Manchester, you become a Manchester.
Craig
Sounds like a judge.
Taylor
Yeah, it does. Yeah, magistrate.
Craig
Yeah, alright, well. On today&rsquo;s show, we&rsquo;re going to talk about video games. In popular culture? Yeah. And it&rsquo;s mainly triggered by this little Grand Theft Auto. Hmm. Hamlet trailer. So we&rsquo;ll listen to this to to put us in the mood.
Speaker 4
Go, go, go, go now. OK, OK. We are putting on a production of Hamlet in GTA Online for the first time ever. We are looking for actors. So come and audition, please. Trying to stop us. Can&rsquo;t stop our mother.
Speaker
Yes.
Speaker 4
Ohh they got me.
Speaker
Ohh, my God, they&rsquo;re really coming down now look. To.
Speaker 1
Be or not to be. That is the question.
Speaker 4
You&rsquo;re welcome to audition if you want. You&rsquo;ll put, don&rsquo;t.
Speaker
You crazy? No. OK. Shoot us please.
Speaker 4
But it is nobler in the mind to suffer.
Speaker
Ohh.
Speaker 5
My God.
Speaker 4
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, or to take arms to get to sea of travel.
Speaker
No one&rsquo;s going to come. No one cares.
Speaker 4
It&rsquo;s not a real thing.
Speaker 1
It&rsquo;s real to me.
Speaker
Ohh, hang on. Someone&rsquo;s here. Hello.
Speaker 5
All right, you can call me Shawn. I&rsquo;m Jen. I&rsquo;m Kelly.
Speaker 4
That&rsquo;s quite an entrance.
Speaker
My name is Gareth.
Speaker 4
While you&rsquo;re doing your dance, we try saying to be or not to be. That is the question.
Speaker 5
Look, my Lord, it comes she&rsquo;s like chick.
Speaker 4
Bear on our billion dollar budget.
Speaker
Cops are here.
Craig
Maybe he&rsquo;s a purist.
Speaker
We just keep coming across these people. We wanna help us.
Speaker 4
That gives me hope that what we&rsquo;re trying to do is possible. Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to Grand Theft Hamlet.
Speaker
Yes.
Craig
OK. Hey, so that&rsquo;s was the synopsis from. Grand Theft. Dang it.
Speaker 6
Although I&rsquo;m not sure if you.
Craig
Heard the Grand Theft Auto. Let me just put. That volume down. Grand Theft Hamlet trailer #1 which details the. In the midst of COVID-19 pandemic, 2 out of work actors Sam and Mark, piece of bleak future. Desperate for purpose, they stumble upon an idea stage Shakespeare&rsquo;s hamlet with the ultraviolet within the ultraviolet world of Grand Theft Auto. Online shot. Entirely in game Grand Theft, Hamlet explores their attempt to merge classical theatre with a chaotic digital landscape. With stunning visuals and unexpected moments of reflection, this engaging documentary examines how ancient cultural narratives. Can still resonate in new virtual spaces, raising questions about art, isolation and the digital world&rsquo;s potential for storytelling.
Taylor
You know, the strange thing about that is how they said like because of COVID-19. That was an out of work actors. Yes, as an actor myself, you&rsquo;re always out of work until some ridiculous director decides to actually put you into a. Production it&rsquo;s pretty.
Craig
Status quo environment to be in, isn&rsquo;t it?
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
Anyway, and this this Harkins back way back, ohh maybe 10-15 years ago I had to teach a class at university on video games, virtual worlds and video games.
Taylor
Yeah, I remember it.
Speaker
And.
Craig
Wasn&rsquo;t. Yeah, you were in it. And I was pitching these ideas around how to take video games and put it into the real world. So to help us on this journey today, we&rsquo;ve brought along our special guest, Leo. Hey, Leo. You do your own show here on Edge every Tuesday.
Leo
Hi. 11 yeah, 11, it&rsquo;s hyperfixation sensation. Yeah, basically spring and running people such as you, Craig.
Craig
That&rsquo;s right. I was on. It&rsquo;s.
Leo
Yeah. So yeah, this Tuesday. So yeah, that&rsquo;s basically Marshall, I guess so.
Speaker 6
Tuesday.
Craig
Yeah. And I we talked about board.
Leo
Games. Oh yeah, we did. Yeah, I found that. It was quite a good show. We got track a couple of times, but.
Craig
It just always happens. So hyper fixation sensation and in many ways media mothership really does take that as its motorsport.
Leo
It&rsquo;s. Fun. Yeah.
Craig
One day it&rsquo;s our whole purpose. We dive deeply into whatever fascination I&rsquo;ve stumbled across that way. Often it&rsquo;s old, the oldie radio from the 1930s, but today we&rsquo;re going high tech modern and we&rsquo;ve got big boy needy already on the chat. Thanks, big boy. Needy. You can of course watch us on.
Taylor
Yeah, exactly. OK.
Craig
YouTube Stream, Twitch Stream, digital broadcast DAB, the FM system on analogue 99.3 FM or just head over to edgeradio.org Dot AU.
Taylor
And send us a message at 488811707.
Craig
Yeah. Which Big Boy Navy has done. Hey, big bosses. Sorry, I&rsquo;m 3 minutes late. I keep forgetting it&rsquo;s Thursday listening whilst I play flight SIM and eat my Dino nuggies. Great because I I know Leah. You&rsquo;re a huge fan.
Leo
Ohh yeah. Yeah, I personally love playing. I used to have yeah explain.
Craig
X plane. Yep. So that&rsquo;s like Microsoft Flight Simulator. It&rsquo;s one of those ones where you can fly from a real world airport. What&rsquo;s some of your flying experiences in X plane?
Leo
So.
Craig
Have you flown from Hobart Airport?
Leo
Yeah, I have so.
Craig
What&rsquo;s it like? Did you crash?
Leo
No. Well, I have crashed before.
Craig
But not in Hobart. Great. What was your biggest crash?
Leo
Well. Probably probably the time when I was messing around with my throttle and I didn&rsquo;t know what the red lever was. Wow.
Craig
Yeah, always do the red lever.
Speaker
If there&rsquo;s a red.
Craig
Yeah.
Leo
Commit. Turns out it was a mixture and I pulled it and my engine stopped.
Craig
Wow. And how did you you didn&rsquo;t recover? What happens just plummeted.
Leo
Well, I tried pushing it. I tried to push it back in, but by that point, now I know later the engine and spool down so I couldn&rsquo;t push it back into favourite.
Craig
Right.
Leo
So what I would have had to have done is restarted my yeah. And I was like 9.
Craig
Was it a propeller plane or a jet?
Leo
Yeah, it was. It was like session 172.
Craig
Plane repellent, rights of fear. Was this over Paris or somewhere exciting?
Leo
Well, it was over. I think it was near the I think I landed on the highway here like on Hwy. Yeah. But in doing so, I smashed into a SUV. Yeah, yeah.
Craig
There&rsquo;s damn SUV&rsquo;s. They should get out of the way of the planes. I mean, Harrison Ford landed on the golf course a few years ago in his, I think as a World War 2 type aeroplane. My favourite bit of video game journalism with flight simulators was this guy. And it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s one of these early new games journalism pieces which tries to do a very immersive non, you know, point scoring approach to video game reviewing. And they did it on one of the early Microsoft Flight Sims and their their their whole review was written about their attempt. To do the like the Lindenberg crossing right. So from New York to London, I think then crossing was. In the same aeroplane, right? So in the flight SIM you can get that same spirit of Saint Louis, whatever it is, aeroplane, but he.
Leo
Isn&rsquo;t that isn&rsquo;t that playing like really hard to?
Craig
See out of it is. Yeah. It&rsquo;s very obscured kind of vision, but what he did was he did it in real time. So it took 12 hours or something and he sat there and he what he did, he said beforehand he wanted to immerse himself, cause it&rsquo;s a simulator, right? It&rsquo;s not a video game. You simulate reality. So what he did is he packed his lunches. He said OK, I&rsquo;ll need. I&rsquo;ll need breakfast and lunches. So sandwiches and so forth probably. Have and I&rsquo;ll. I&rsquo;ll be in this seat, he. Did I think? He allowed himself toilet breaks. Yeah, I hope he did. I don&rsquo;t remember the toilet discussion.
Taylor
And he took altitude medication and those squishy socks. Yeah.
Craig
That&rsquo;s right, anti nausea. And he said it was, you know, the first part of the game was kind of exciting, but then it&rsquo;s just really boring you just some. And I know people have done that with Euro Truck Simulator where they&rsquo;ll do a fundraiser where it&rsquo;ll just be because it&rsquo;s one again one of these.
Leo
Yeah.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
Leaders where it&rsquo;s just they&rsquo;ll take the. Just you know US truck journey and they&rsquo;ll say I&rsquo;m live streaming it for the next 8 hours, which is the real time it would take to go from, I don&rsquo;t know, New York to California and that&rsquo;s it. That&rsquo;s the stream and they&rsquo;ll be raising money and and all this is kind of like ultimately what I want to arrive at. By the end of today&rsquo;s episode, so in the next 40 minutes, is is how we can put media mothership in some form of video game, right? Like to do a video game and media mothership at the same time, like Hamlet in GTA. You know, we brainstorm, like, have you played?
Leo
Roblox you have.
Craig
Because I reckon. That the even the equipment here could play Roblox. On.
Speaker
OK.
Craig
Could we do a? Media Mothership episode live in a Roblox space.
Leo
Yeah, I actually could.
Craig
Is there a? Is there a? Is there a radio studio in Roblox? Is there a radio studio game?
Leo
Uh. Make one.
Craig
There we go. So join us on our Kickstarter. We just need to do a hire a video game.
Leo
If there&rsquo;s any Roblox developers message in on 0488811707 or you can find our number on the top left of our website at radio.org dot AU. It should be. On the little.
Craig
Banner thing? That&rsquo;s right. The little banner thing. Alright and you&rsquo;re joining media. The ship here. On.
Taylor
It&rsquo;s ready.
Craig
3899.3 I want to get my kalimba. Can you finish the rest of the?
Taylor
OK. Yeah. No, no, I actually don&rsquo;t have anything to say. Craig is going and getting his kalimba out of his bag. He&rsquo;s wearing a blue cap today and red shirt red. Sort of. Yeah. Jumper thing and.
Leo
Red shirt. Black losses.
Craig
All right, welcome. Back that was worth it. It breaks the. Me. Audio space people wake. Up they might be falling asleep. We&rsquo;re talking about video games with our special guest Leo and our co-host Magister Taylor and Doctor Craig. Actually, we need to find the title for you by the end of the show, so we&rsquo;ll brainstorm a bit of news and video games. I did do a survey of current video game news. Let&rsquo;s play.
Leo
Yeah, probably.
Craig
A sample of this. It&rsquo;s from the latest Chinese video game.
Taylor
Turn the volume up.
Craig
That&rsquo;s not the name. Ohh on this? Yeah.
Taylor
But no on that. Ohh yet.
Craig
Video. Games called Wu Chang full and feathers.
Taylor
Wu.
Craig
Chang Wu Chang and here&rsquo;s here&rsquo;s the title. Woo Chang got hit by the censorship hammer here. We.
Taylor
OK.
Craig
Go.
Speaker 6
Well, I&rsquo;m not sure if you heard it. This game got censored by. By their own developers, essentially like changing the entire game. The changing all of the storyline, everything. No, no, the censorship is not because of fanservice. It&rsquo;s because during the entire game. The changing all of the storyline, everything. No, no, the censorship is not because of fanservice. It&rsquo;s because in this game. Our protagonist essentially is killing the Ming dynasty, the remnants of the Ming dynasty. Who are? People of Han like. Descendants of Han the Han people. That&rsquo;s why Chinese Chinese fans were mad about this. This is essentially talking about the Manchurian like. Oh, the manchurians overtaking the Ming dynasty. That&rsquo;s why people are kind of mad about this. Not because of like the fan service, mainly because of historical stuff.
Craig
All right. So that was a starry in TV and his take on the censorship hammer in Wu Chang, full and feathers. So if you didn&rsquo;t catch what he was saying, what&rsquo;s happened is that there was a patch recently done, which meant that it it basically transformed entirely. The type of challenges you face in this game. It&rsquo;s a souls like game, right? So you know it&rsquo;s you got Insta death and it&rsquo;s quite challenging and you know quite photorealistic it&rsquo;s set in this kind of ancient Chinese period where you can challenge various big bosses, but it transform those challenges so that you can no longer.
Speaker
MHM.
Craig
Kill those classic Ming dynasty mythical boss figures. You can only exhaust them, and that was because there was a right wing conservative national. Backlash against this game, saying hey, you can&rsquo;t kill our national figures in this game, right? These these mythological symbols of China.
Taylor
Yeah. Going against again against the hand people, which consists which make up like 85% of the entire population of China. So it&rsquo;s a, it&rsquo;s a big number.
Craig
Deserve more respect. Right, that&rsquo;s. So it meant that the the the games own developers went back into it, modified that. Many people have saying that has resulted in. In breaking the game, because you can know, you can now no longer, you know, finish certain parts of it. You can&rsquo;t get these award. You can&rsquo;t, so it kind of contradicts the whole stakes that the games built up around. So there&rsquo;s an article in rock, Paper, Shotgun, PC gaming since 1873. 1873 piece of gaming. So it&rsquo;s.
Taylor
Close to when you were born, right?
Craig
I&rsquo;m nearly 200.
Taylor
Ohh no, I was 19, not 18.
Craig
After which young, full and fair, there&rsquo;s controversial Patch 1.5 made key bosses immortal. Here&rsquo;s the obligatory rollback. Mod So Video Gamer has modded it to reintroduce the deaths of those characters in a mod. So so yeah, go for it, mods. Well, it&rsquo;s always a happy kind of, you know, some of these models do all the heavy lifting for fixing, you know, when when the.
Speaker
Brilliant.
Craig
Updates break the.
Leo
Game a lot of games I&rsquo;ve played, they&rsquo;ve had a lot of problems with updates breaking games. Such as running on art, which is? Well, I believe we&rsquo;re gonna be talking about.
Craig
Later. Is that correct? Yeah. Well, let&rsquo;s go into that now. So ready. Or not was the. It&rsquo;s like a a game video game.
Leo
First person, first person shooter. Basically, you&rsquo;re a tactical SWAT officer and you run a team of five people, including yourself, so it can be AI. It can be real people, so you know, with real people you can have as many people as you like under 5 people. But there are some odds. That allow you to. Have more. Basically, my microphone is a little bit muscle because it keeps on sinking and I lift it up. So basically you are a spot officer and you try to disable any kind of any kind of threats and you try to preserve life.
Craig
It does.
Leo
Like most other tactical shooters where you&rsquo;re trying to actively, you know, shoot people and kill them. In ready or not, one really cool thing that I like about it is you&rsquo;re actually almost like a real spot officer where you&rsquo;re trying to actually stop people from dying by using less lethal munitions and stuff like that. And the only way to be able to get the S rank, which is the highest rank inside of each server, is by not having. Anyone die? Wow. Whatsoever. So it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a lot more of a different type of type of tactical shooter than most other tactical shooters out there, such as Fortnite, or that&rsquo;s not exactly tactical, but like.
Craig
Well, this team. Work sometimes.
Leo
But yeah, it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a lot. It&rsquo;s a lot different to a lot of other shooters out there, you know, so.
Craig
Yeah. Well, actually dovetails into what, big boy? Needy. Thanks again for messaging in Big Boy. Needy has messaging just there saying there are GTA modded servers, they do like role play servers. The client is called 5 M so you could look them up. So that&rsquo;s so that we could. Think about if we get a computer that can play GTA, but that sounds very role play based, right? Ready or not. Well, let&rsquo;s listen to the trailer. I&rsquo;ve I&rsquo;ve pulled up the trailer here for radio or not. Are you ready? Official 1.0 launch from last year.
Leo
Not exactly role play. No, exactly.
Speaker 5
911 this call is being recorded. What is your emergency? I I need the police to you need to send the police. Right away. Come help me. Sorry, I&rsquo;m sorry.
Speaker
You ready? Yes, Sir. Ready. Move, move, move. Take it down. Back down, Freddy&rsquo;s down.
Speaker 5
Over the situation I got fall back.
Speaker 4
Charlie&rsquo;s gotta get you.
Speaker
Ready. Drop your weapon.
Speaker 4
Down we head back up.
Speaker
What? So make it out of. This. Drop the gun. Let.
Speaker 5
Her go. I&rsquo;m not going.
Speaker 1
So Are you ready?
Craig
Alright, so that was ready or not. Are you ready? Official 1.0 launch trailer we had talking about video games, immersive video games, and I&rsquo;m doctor Craig, joined by Multicolor Taylor.
Taylor
3.
Craig
It&rsquo;s magic, Magister Taylor and DJ Leo. At this point, DJ Leo, we&rsquo;ll go with DJ Leo.
Taylor
Registered.
Leo
Personally.
Craig
We&rsquo;ll keep workshopping that. And so why do you need to be ready to play this game if you&rsquo;re not ready, do you lose? Game.
Leo
So there is a certain mode where if you aren&rsquo;t ready, then you lose. It&rsquo;s called Ironman mode. So basically you need to run in and it&rsquo;s very similar to real life where if you die you lose your entire save file. You ohh nice. Yeah, I love that man, yeah.
Craig
All right. Instant permadeath. But you don&rsquo;t die in real life. Till that&rsquo;s clear, it&rsquo;s not the matrix.
Leo
Unless you use the VR mode where where you can, you know that you know, you know that you know that the headset that can kill you if you lose inside of.
Craig
It&rsquo;s like the matrix. Ohh wow is that the one?
Leo
A game. Yeah, yeah.
Craig
That I use and you make.
Leo
That&rsquo;s a that&rsquo;s also the arm on. So if you use those two combined, then you know.
Craig
Sounds like the saw movie or something, yeah?
Taylor
Kinda.
Craig
I I reckon we could do photojournalism in that game, right? We&rsquo;ll be interviewing the other people that play the game while we&rsquo;re playing it. Is it a multiplayer game? Yes. Yeah. Yeah. So I&rsquo;d. Say you know I&rsquo;m an in bed from. The Murdoch newspaper and I&rsquo;m here to to to create a news story and and we&rsquo;ll do it live radio.
Taylor
You&rsquo;re a. You&rsquo;re a. You&rsquo;re a what?
Craig
In bed. In bed, in bed in bed. Ohh. You&rsquo;re listening to me? Your mothership here on Edge Radio 99.3 film. And yeah, yeah, cause Time magazine actually did this where they sent one of their news photo journalists into who, who, who covered numerous war zones, and they gave him his his assignment for one of the time magazines was go into the video game. Last of Us and create a photojournalism report on it as if you&rsquo;re a photojournalist in an actual world setting and he said he found it actually really difficult to not create basically advertising for the video game because it looks so. Good. And you can craft video games. So what? So you can there are some video games where you can get like a photo mode or you can create like a screenshot from it. And they&rsquo;re designed for creating really engaging photos that you share. And he was saying he was able to create some. Some pieces which were gesturing quite classical, photojournalism, conflict, war zone pieces, but he was saying, yeah, actually by the end of it, he felt it was desensitising the video game experience left him quite worried about the the type of media effect with. Games. How have you found ready or not in terms of, you know, cause at one level there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s guns and violence, but then another level cause it&rsquo;s cop you&rsquo;re having to to do a lot of real World Team building, communicating some really important skills. How do you find the team building nature of radio or not? You multiplay on it. Or single play.
Leo
Yeah, I do play. I do multiplayer on it sometimes, but at the moment I&rsquo;m mostly single playing it, but with AI teammates. But something really cool I&rsquo;ve discovered when it comes to a single player is you actually have to deal with your teammates stress. So if your teammates become too stressed, they&rsquo;re like if they become anxious, they&rsquo;re their performance degrades. If they become stressed.
Craig
Yeah.
Leo
Even more degrades if they become a crisis like in crisis. Then they can either quit or they get intervention from the therapist.
Craig
In the game.
Leo
Yeah, in the.
Craig
Game really, really is there, like a stress metre or something like how does it? How does it detect your?
Leo
Stress levels, not your stress levels, your teammate stress levels.
Craig
I was really hoping you could weigh yourself up to it. I just blow it immediately.
Leo
So basically, the more people that die inside a mission, the higher the stresses. So if they see your teammate die or something like that, right?
Craig
Right. The game would say in a normal setting this character would be suffering this level of stress. I&rsquo;ve heard of a similar mechanic in the the thing. Game, where there&rsquo;s a paranoia which can tip you over the edge.
Leo
So basically, yeah, you can do multiple things to do to fix stress. Main thing is going to be sending them into a therapist, but that means that there&rsquo;s gonna be two missions where you don&rsquo;t have your specific officer cause.
Craig
They&rsquo;re, they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;ve, they&rsquo;ve gotten their car and gone. To a therapist? Yeah. To go have an appointment.
Leo
And then and the next thing that you can do is get S bags. I don&rsquo;t know what that stands for so.
Craig
Don&rsquo;t ask. See that would be. I mean we could do medium mother ship in there. I wonder how quickly we&rsquo;d be sent to see if. Therapist because of the content and be like you guys are not healthy. This is not a healthy discussion. I suggest therapy.
Leo
And then. It&rsquo;s also moral, moral, something. Basically they they heavily make suspects mental health. I mean, not suspects. Teammates. Mental health better by helping bring suspects out alive. So.
Craig
So you&rsquo;re actually incentivised.
Leo
Yeah. So there&rsquo;s many different things. Yeah, there&rsquo;s many things inside of the game which kind of encourages you to bring out your suspects alive.
Craig
Bring people out alive. Because normally you&rsquo;d see like a health media for a character, but there are these other metres or these other feedback you&rsquo;re getting on the screen, the HUD telling you of the the mental health state of the the character you&rsquo;re in.
Leo
That&rsquo;s not. That&rsquo;s not until you&rsquo;re at the end of the game, like at the.
Craig
Right. Which is so much like life. It&rsquo;s not until I finished the episode that I realised.
Leo
End of the mission.
Craig
How traumatic I am. Yeah. How much therapy I need?
Leo
So so for example, you know every single, every single step that you take inside of the game. Really matters, yes. So yeah, if you take one step to the right, there could be a suspect over there with 762AK47. And you can die and.
Craig
So the stakes are high. Yeah, right. And and as you&rsquo;re saying, if you&rsquo;re playing Imam, the that&rsquo;s it. The character points you&rsquo;ve accumulated, they&rsquo;re just gone.
Leo
And that&rsquo;s the other cool things about it is it&rsquo;s realistic. You don&rsquo;t exactly see any health bars or any. It&rsquo;s.
Craig
Literally right.
Leo
Like you, you can see a little body of yours in the bottom left, and then you can see you know what parts of your body are injured. So for example, if your right leg is injured and you try to kick down a door, it gets even more injured. And then once it becomes critical, your right leg, you&rsquo;re unable to kick down. Doors and the great thing here.
Craig
Is this is in a safe space? Right. You&rsquo;re not physically kicking down the door. Yourself. Yeah, which I think is a huge relief to most people. It&rsquo;s interesting was I had a student once in, in. That video game unit. Who did his project on? You know his dad and his elder brother were part of the military, and he wasn&rsquo;t part of the military, but he loved playing Call of Duty and other first person shooter games. So he did a project on, you know, does military service help you get better scores? In Call of Duty, right. So he said. Yeah, yeah. Can you shoot better? And he said, you know, he interviewed because his brother and his dad played Call of Duty, and they would have their own squad and all the people in the squad would be ex military or current military.
Taylor
Can you shoot better? That sort of thing?
Craig
And he said as he was watching them, like he went around to a friend&rsquo;s place and they were playing the game and or he&rsquo;s listening online is they were doing it, he said. One of the things that he found that was the biggest difference was the communication they. Were able to. Do that, he said that as opposed to when he plays with his mates, where if you give anyone feedback. They can act up and get really angry and say, well, buddy, I&rsquo;m not playing with you anymore. I&rsquo;m playing it to have fun. Stop telling me. What to do? Instead, these guys would actually take on any criticism that do a debrief and discuss, and they wouldn&rsquo;t take it personally, he said. That was the thing that was most surprised at the fact that. That it was that communication, that&rsquo;s what they said. They said that, you know, it&rsquo;s a huge difference between firing a real gun and the virtual gun. There&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s no correlation. Like it won&rsquo;t help you if you have good real gun skills like a soldier does to be good gun game guy in the game, it&rsquo;s completely different. Lot of mechanisms and kind of twitch and muscle. Sorry, but what we&rsquo;ll help. We&rsquo;ll help you, he said in his project. Was the fact that his brother and his dad were able to take on criticism and teamwork and Co-op much better than him and his mates who would always get angry. At each other. And be like wouldn&rsquo;t use their words to explain. The frustration in the game, so yeah, I do think a game like that could be really helpful in in building up discussion. So when you&rsquo;ve played it online. Is it with other people from Australia or?
Leo
Other countries, primarily Australia, just because of paying and you know Internet speeds and stuff like that. That&rsquo;s how it works for most online games. Yeah. So I actually made one friend off of it. Yeah, it was pretty fun. One thing I do have to say about the communication side of the game. When it comes to single play, again, you actually have really strong communication abilities. So basically if you medically you can select. Orders. So number one is moved to #2.
Craig
Right, giving instructions to your virtual.
Speaker
Is.
Leo
Squad. Yeah, #2. I believe it&rsquo;s fallen. And then we&rsquo;re full and you can pick between Wedge Diamond, single file and double file lines.
Craig
And that could really help going to Woolworths right when you&rsquo;re shopping with friends. And it&rsquo;s like falling single file line here please, because we&rsquo;re going into the the single extend it&rsquo;s difficult to tell people.
Leo
What to do? Move in, move in clear with flashback.
Craig
I&rsquo;d love that feature in the real world.
Leo
Clear the clear the measly I&rsquo;ll flashback.
Craig
We&rsquo;ve got a message from Big Boy Lady, my brother in law is in the army and when he wasn&rsquo;t in when he isn&rsquo;t working, he&rsquo;s playing Call of Duty. There&rsquo;s some concern that he&rsquo;s worried that he just wants to kill.
Speaker 4
Yes.
Craig
Yes, but there is a difference between the virtual world and the real world. Fortunately, button is sending a nice sum 🙂 to you.
Taylor
Mr Lidstone, what&rsquo;s that?
Craig
Button. Do you know a button? Button. Yes. Thank you anyway. Button for messaging.
Taylor
Well, how do you know this?
Craig
And it to me because it says I the the less than symbol three you. Mr listen. I think that&rsquo;s a.
Leo
Heart. Yeah, that&rsquo;s a heart.
Taylor
Oh dear.
Leo
So was it I heart, Mr Lidstone.
Taylor
Yes, yeah, yeah. Let&rsquo;s stop using. My last name, OK.
Craig
It&rsquo;s true, magistry. Patton, it&rsquo;s Jimmy in Green Nine. OK, there you go. It&rsquo;s all falling into place. So we&rsquo;re talking here on media mothership. On Edge Radio 99.3 FM you can play it tough. No, man. If you think you have better Columbo skills than the master DJ Craig, feel free to let us know in the chat. We&rsquo;ll get you in my future. So it is.
Leo
Doctor Craig. Doctor DJ Craig.
Craig
Yeah, the D stands for Doctor.
Taylor
J. Stand for.
Craig
DJ Yeah, let&rsquo;s keep that mystery.
Taylor
OK.
Craig
This point. So yes, we&rsquo;re talking here about video games and immersive video games, and some of the skills that we can accomplish from it and potentially how we can put ourselves into video games in a constructive and healthy fashion. We&rsquo;ve got a special guest, Leo. DJ Leo, joined by Magistrate Taylor.
Taylor
And not magistrate magister.
Craig
Ohh I&rsquo;m I just said. That&rsquo;s right. That&rsquo;s my confusion. And we&rsquo;re we&rsquo;re looking for the games unusual ways people have used video games to to do things I. Wanna go through?
Taylor
Surgeon.
Craig
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. No. No. Well, so playing Call of Duty according to the Geneva Convention is my favourite. So this was a classic. It was posted on Kotaku many years ago. Sounds like.
Taylor
Yeah. And you&rsquo;ve and you&rsquo;ve brought it up on this radio about 12 times.
Craig
I know every time. 12 yeah. Yeah. Because I mean, I mean, it sounds like you could do the Geneva Convention and ready or not.
Leo
I&rsquo;ve broken. I&rsquo;ve broken the Geneva Convention one too many times, and really.
Craig
Really. You&rsquo;re amongst friends, Leo. It&rsquo;s OK. And. And plus we&rsquo;ve we, you know, we&rsquo;ve obscured your ruining by saying DJ in. Front of us. Yeah, playing Call of Duty. According to the new Convention, one of my favourite all time video game articles from Kotaku was talking about a dad whose son wanted to play Call of Duty, and the son was like 12 and thought little too early for you. But let&rsquo;s play it together. If you read the entire Geneva Convention 1st and we&rsquo;ll sit down and we&rsquo;ll play the game together and talk about how the Geneva Convention. Can help us? Play it. There was a clip I found actually of someone trying. I don&rsquo;t know if they. Were trying it. There&rsquo;s a lot of clips. When I looked at Geneva Convention Call of Duty, which are people breaking the Geneva Convention, and here&rsquo;s one called. Breaking the Geneva Convention in Call of Duty.
Speaker 8
The Geneva Convention has been broken in Call of Duty zombies and. Here&rsquo;s how. Actually, you can&rsquo;t shoot me. You can&rsquo;t shoot me in Chernobyl, cause apparently it&rsquo;s against Geneva Conventions. So please do not. Show me. Approximately in 13 seconds I will die from radiation poisoning.
Craig
Yep. So that that&rsquo;s pretty much the level of engagement with the Geneva Convention video game YouTube, but this one was, yeah, Dad tried to play it. And of course mainly the Geneva Convention. It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s, you know, once the soldier appears to be surrendering, you can&rsquo;t shoot. OK, which is the problem that many people have found that there&rsquo;s, like there&rsquo;s the no Russia level in cool G4. I think we&rsquo;re basically you&rsquo;re part. Of a US embed in a Russian terrorist cell that then is in an airport. Yeah, you cannot. You can choose not to fire, but basically you know you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re witnessing. Yeah. Yeah. A a complete breach of the Geneva Convention. Pretty.
Taylor
Can.
Speaker
Yeah.
Taylor
Pretty. Shocking that one when I first. Played it, yeah.
Craig
Speed running this type of challenge run in which players attempt to complete a game as quickly as possible. Speed runners often use glitches and exploits to shave off seconds or even minutes from their time. Speed running can be very challenging and rewarding. Have you tried to speed run any games?
Leo
Just received a message, yeah.
Taylor
It says it&rsquo;s cod Modern Warfare 2.
Craig
Oh, is that the one with the no Russian level?
Taylor
Leave say that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re referring. To I think so.
Craig
Yeah, yeah. I mean, it got so much news. It was such an interesting intersection of real world. Nervousness around terrorism and yeah, I mean and very much in Australia at that point where there was a a heavy kind of nerf hammer on video games, there wasn&rsquo;t an R18 classification yet in video games at that.
Taylor
Hmm.
Craig
So people in 80S said the Geneva Convention for losers don&rsquo;t think a healthy conversation.
Taylor
But I think I think it gives sort of like because he&rsquo;s a a kid in school and the the father with his with his kid. So did that kid who his father forced him to play via Geneva Convention? Yeah.
Craig
Oh yeah.
Taylor
Did that kid? Like his father growing up.
Craig
Well, yeah. I mean, yeah, how would you react to your father or your parent if they required you to play the the game coins? Do you mention right? What&rsquo;s what does Chachi PT say for how to?
Taylor
Does he still talk to him anymore?
Craig
Handle that conversation. Speed. Or have you done speed runs? Are you a?
Taylor
Speed runner? Yeah, I&rsquo;ve tried to speed run things.
Craig
Before Sonic the Hedgehog. I didn&rsquo;t think you as a Sonic guy. No, that&rsquo;s.
Taylor
9. Surprising try to speed. Run. Yeah, Yoshi&rsquo;s island.
Craig
You know, she&rsquo;s island. Is that the one like the green Dino? Is that yeah.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
She yeah, yeah.
Taylor
What else have I speed run?
Craig
Actually.
Taylor
I&rsquo;ve never finished Skyrim, ever.
Craig
Really, this is a game we talk about. With you all the time. Yeah. Finished. Minecraft Mike. Well, yeah, you can&rsquo;t finish.
Taylor
Can you finish Minecraft?
Leo
Yeah, you can beat the Ender Dragon.
Taylor
OK.
Craig
Well, maybe one of the challenges for the game, really or not, is is a a no hit. Run right. This type of challenge run, in which players attempt to complete the game without taking. Damage. This can be incredibly difficult and it requires a great deal of skill and practise. Yeah, you&rsquo;ve not been hitting the red.
Leo
I&rsquo;ve done it before. Yeah.
Craig
Do you get an award? Did it pop up?
Leo
No, it was only. It was only on one. It was only on one mission.
Craig
In steam saying. You&rsquo;re just hitting the corner.
Leo
No, I somehow it was on the first level and it was on normal mode. So it was quite easy because I&rsquo;ve done that mission. It&rsquo;s called 4 year gas station and basically it&rsquo;s a bunch of guys are addicted to drugs and they need drug money.
Speaker
That&rsquo;s fine.
Leo
So they decided to rob a gas station and for some reason SWAT gets. Yes, right. So that&rsquo;s the easiest level and I managed not to take any damage and nor did any of my teammates, yeah.
Craig
Big Boy, 80s message and saying the Australian Defence Force is pretty infamous for war crimes as of in the Middle East, with whistleblowers being arrested. I think that&rsquo;s the.
Taylor
That&rsquo;s true.
Craig
Great thing about this conversation for helping. Yeah. Yeah. Well, it&rsquo;s all reflections of real world situation. So we could talk comically about the Geneva Convention and.
Taylor
Bringing it back to.
Craig
And you know how difficult it would be to get beyond the loading screen in Call of Duty to play it. But nevertheless, I mean, it&rsquo;s a good space to ask questions about it. Why? Is it so? Difficult and and should you know should should we require that as a challenge in some first person shooters?
Leo
My teachers keep on getting angry whenever I use the word. Why? Because I use. It way too much.
Craig
Why?
Leo
I just thought I&rsquo;d bring that up because you.
Craig
Used the word why right? Well, yeah. We&rsquo;re to spread all the W&rsquo;s. Who, what? When, why, where, how?
Leo
Yeah. So if you hear any laughing, that&rsquo;s my mom in the.
Craig
Back corner. Yes. Thank you for coming. We we haven&rsquo;t put you on mic yet. I guess that&rsquo;s lucky. Next time how about this with this challenge playing with unusual controllers, this type of challenge run in which plays attempt to complete a game using.
Speaker
Right.
Leo
An unusual control, you know that. Car here. Guitar. Yeah.
Craig
Yeah, yeah, exactly. Using the Guitar Hero guitar. A steering wheel. Right. Anything that&rsquo;s meant for another game, right? So the stern will feature.
Taylor
No, not, not even. Not even really another game cause the one I&rsquo;m thinking of when as soon as you said that was the person that was playing Pok&eacute;mon through. Which no what.
Craig
There&rsquo;s Twitch plays Pok&eacute;mon where the Twitch subscribers to this thing told him how to play it.
Taylor
No, no, no, no, no. Through flute.
Craig
Through flute, like a flute.
Speaker 8
Colinda.
Taylor
Yeah, yeah. And depending on which note it was because they had like a a Raspberry Pi when up, which was linked up to a microphone which took the signal of what key was being played. And then it would then move the character up or down or left, right, AB.
Craig
Wow, we could do the show by the notes I take as the conversation that&rsquo;s created. Like that.
Taylor
So instead of talking, you just play that sounds.
Leo
No.
Taylor
Great. No, I took it. I.
Craig
Took it up to Checchi PT and it would be like that. Would then tried to say you know you must now. Ask the following question on a.
Leo
Imagine imagine, if like you imagine if you&rsquo;re in a gunfight and you just hear.
Speaker 4
Yeah.
Leo
BIM, BIM.
Craig
It&rsquo;s very immersive in this studio. Super Mario Brothers was originally designed to be played with AD PAT, but plays quickly, discovered that they could also use the directional buttons to jump higher. This led to the development of bee hopping. Technique which is used by speedrunners today. The more you know. Legend of Ocarina, Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time.
Speaker
Yeah.
Taylor
Yeah.
Speaker 4
Have you spoken of all?
Taylor
The words in that sentence. Yeah, I&rsquo;ve played that.
Craig
Before this was originally designed to be played in a linear fashion, but players quickly discovered that they could break out of the games. Boundaries and explore the world freely. This led to the development of the Zelda speedrunning community. Dark Souls is a notoriously difficult game, but players have found a number of ways to make it easier. Have you played Dark Souls? This is one of those permadeath games, right? I think it&rsquo;s a recent game like you die and you have to go way back to an early start point. For example for some players. Develop glitch runs where which are completed without using any glitches or exploits. Others have developed, no hit runs.
Taylor
Yeah. I just remember it wasn&rsquo;t Mario. It was Call of Duty, Molly. Yeah. So there was this fellow he was going like PIP and then it would put the the reticle over to the left a little bit. And because he was playing sniper and then he go and then it would shoot.
Craig
Oh crazy. The Sims is another notorious one where people do all manner of bizarre psychosocial experiments on their their SIM creation. Have you played The Sims a bit like Minecraft?
Leo
A little bit. I&rsquo;m also played blocksburg but.
Craig
Blocksburg is that on Roblox? Yeah. Is that one that mine, that media mothership could do an episode in?
Leo
Yeah, I guess, but it&rsquo;s kind of boring.
Craig
We looks get in touch with.
Leo
Us now, yeah, multibillion dollar company.
Craig
0 fortunately. Yeah, they&rsquo;re a friend of the show. I know. There&rsquo;s the controversy around there.
Taylor
We&rsquo;ve lost a lot, man.
Craig
What was it? They. Kept.
Leo
A child psyche.
Craig
Yeah, yeah, they, they, they kicked off. Who who was behaving.
Leo
Schlep schlepp. Badly. No. He he he. Yeah, he was. He was trying to. He was trying to. Yeah. He was trying to. He was trying to arrest paedophiles. And Roblox decided to ban him for quoting, quote, taking conversations off platform and and also failing to report incidents through the correct avenues. OK.
Craig
Ohh he was behaving good, right? He was in crapping paedophiles.
Leo
Reporting it directly to. Blocks.
Craig
I mean, that&rsquo;s a huge own goal. That&rsquo;s a. Huge epic fail.
Speaker
Yeah.
Craig
On a company that&rsquo;s meant to be child safe. Yeah, big boy. Need his message. And saying he grew up on The Sims 3. Because I&rsquo;ve heard I&rsquo;ve heard people.
Taylor
Believe that.
Craig
Have like they&rsquo;ve created like a A a swimming pool or something. Given the people a phobia of water and then removed the letters from the swimming pool and put all the characters in there.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
And just seeing them. You know basically need a therapist.
Speaker
By.
Craig
Feel free to send your confessions, Big boy needy to the chats you&rsquo;ve inflicted in Sims 3. You&rsquo;re amongst friends.
Leo
Anyone else that wants to say any confessions messaging on 04888 is a. 110.
Craig
707 yeah, 0488811707 or jump on the YouTube or Twitch chat. That to send us your thoughts of your own experiences in in gaming.
Taylor
Or if you want to contact Doctor Craig directly, his number is.
Craig
Just cause I said. You&rsquo;re sending money. The the stakes have risen.
Taylor
Yes.
Leo
You can, I say, find out phone number on the top left of the website edgeradio.org dot AU. That&rsquo;s something that I just like including on my shows because it&rsquo;s a lot. Easier for most people.
Craig
It&rsquo;s true. Yeah. If you go to our website or the Edge Radio website WWW.
Leo
Seems like we only. 10 minutes, yes.
Craig
Yeah. Yeah. So we&rsquo;re wrapping up now what video game are you currently playing?
Leo
Yeah. Ready or not?
Craig
Radio knots. Yeah. Yeah, high rotation. I&rsquo;m playing the digital version of a board game, Spirit Island, because I did so badly with it. Yeah, yeah, I tanked it. I tanked it.
Taylor
In real life.
Craig
Right. It&rsquo;s a Co-op game, and if one person doesn&rsquo;t do well, it&rsquo;s kind of like everyone tries to help you. Things like, I feel like there&rsquo;s a. Yeah, I just need some military training to understand. How to get constructive criticism?
Leo
So one quick question, what is your decision? Are you going to Father&rsquo;s Day or are you going to see drawers?
Craig
Right. I got the date. Wrong. Ohh really? Father&rsquo;s Day&rsquo;s not this Sunday. It&rsquo;s next Sunday. I don&rsquo;t know. That&rsquo;s maybe it&rsquo;s my kids trying not to do it for me.
Leo
Oh.
Craig
Dance. Not next, not not this Saturday.
Taylor
Yeah, cause this it must be next it. Must be next 7th.
Craig
Yeah, 7:00.
Leo
That that bang was his phone. Don&rsquo;t worry, guys. No, nothing&rsquo;s going on. No. Ready. Or not stuff.
Craig
What video game are you playing?
Speaker
At the moment.
Taylor
I&rsquo;m going through all of the different rogue likes at the moment, actually.
Craig
Really, rube. So what is the rogue like genre?
Taylor
There&rsquo;s one of those ones where or rogue like rogue like.
Craig
LIGHT, not LIKE.
Taylor
No LOKE&amp;LITE. They&rsquo;re both sort of legit and and people don&rsquo;t really understand the difference between anyway, so it doesn&rsquo;t matter, but it&rsquo;s basically one of those things where you go through iteratively getting stronger through a loop, sort of.
Craig
I was saying like. They&rsquo;re both. Part of the joner.
Speaker
Then.
Craig
Thing. So it&rsquo;s a kind of like you start as a white belt. Friday guy and you get your yellow. Belt.
Taylor
No. You start as a. You start as a white belt karate. Go play the game. Get up to yellow and then you die. So you start back as a white belt karate guy, but you&rsquo;ve got an extra punch. You can do every round, that sort of thing.
Craig
Really. So what games are like these what?
Taylor
Are some of the, well, the the ones I&rsquo;m playing on my phone at the?
Craig
Moment are balatro balatro any balatro players out there, feel free to challenge. Healer during the kicks the the fundraiser, we&rsquo;ll set it up as a. Fundraiser have you ever played?
Leo
That like, is it a board?
Taylor
Game. It&rsquo;s a card game. It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a card card game, sort of. No, it&rsquo;s not all kind of as a deck builder, but it&rsquo;s like a you, you.
Craig
Oh, OK, no. The deck building.
Taylor
Get poker hands. But you then play against the computer just to a pre generated amount, and then you&rsquo;ve got all of these different Joker cards which have got all these different effects right to give you. More, more money. And it keeps getting harder and harder.
Craig
But it&rsquo;s not gambling.
Taylor
It&rsquo;s not gambling.
Craig
Because yeah, yeah, I mean. And one of the things in a future episode, I&rsquo;d love to get on to in media mothership if I can get some research, maybe in neuroscientist on, on the show to interview is video games in the brain, right, the the serotonin that gets released, the dopamine that gets. At least. The no ripping friend. Ohh you know that one.
Leo
No epinephrine.
Craig
So this this, this neurotransmitter is associated with alertness and focus. Video games, especially action packed or competitive ones, can stimulate the brain stress response, leading to increased no RIP.
Leo
No. How do you say it? No preference, no. No epinephrine, no repairin. No, no, no epinephrine, no epinephrine.
Taylor
My my question, my question is so you know how Elon Musk is getting everyone to get mind control through neural link and things like that.
Leo
The next one.
Craig
Isn&rsquo;t it ketamine?
Taylor
Neuralink well you, you you know how.
Craig
OK.
Taylor
You know the Tetris effect.
Craig
Ohh yes yeah. When people see the Tetris puzzle in the real world after they&rsquo;ve played it.
Taylor
Yeah, so, so you, you, you play Tetris for like 5 to 10 hours and then when you close your eyes you can see Tetris. Yeah. Do you reckon in the future that people will be able to hack into your neurolink and then play Tetris in your mind because it&rsquo;s in your mind as your.
Craig
And then suddenly everything. Well, yeah. And I was saying, yeah.
Taylor
Visualising it.
Craig
I mean it does. I mean, it&rsquo;s a shame. We&rsquo;ve only got. 6 minutes left.
Leo
Ready this? Be some pretty interesting things to the quite similar. In fact, I somewhat consider even better than Neuralink, such as like there&rsquo;s this new field called biohacking where you.
Speaker
Boom.
Leo
Quite literally, hack your own body in a way so I&rsquo;ve actually met someone that had a chip inside of their inside of their like webbing between their fun and their. Next finger and basically they allowed them to unlock their house by just tapping their hand up against their front door.
Craig
Yes, yes, it opens up all these questions, doesn&rsquo;t it?
Leo
Yeah, and.
Craig
About audience, yeah.
Taylor
And they say most people regret their tattoos.
Craig
And that&rsquo;s true, yeah. Tattoos as a really. Sorry, reflection on some poor choices in life, let alone and you. Feel like that&rsquo;s. Permanent and then getting a little bio card chip thing on you to to.
Leo
It&rsquo;s just some of the pretty cool things, such as some people have actually. Quite literally, put magnets into their fingers into their ears that they can feel or hear magnetic vibrations and feel electric fields and stuff like that. I found that quite interesting.
Craig
Entirely look, and they do feel that you know, media and technology can fundamentally change and rewire. Mines in really interesting ways.
Leo
I had a. I heard a story about someone that had a a magnetic finger plant inside of their fingers. It cold it between your middle finger and your pinky finger.
Craig
Right, yes, that the ring.
Leo
Finger. Yeah, the ring finger. So they had a magnetic implants, like the ring finger. And as they were going through a through a metal detector, they suddenly started looking around because they felt something and they didn&rsquo;t know what it was. But instead of looking at their finger, they naturally started looking around, indicating that they actually developed a new sense. It wasn&rsquo;t just them feeling that. Their finger was vibrating. They actually thought there was something nearby.
Craig
Them. Yeah, look, and you know, the cochlear implant is.
Taylor
And then three years later, they need an MRI and by by fingers.
Craig
It&rsquo;s very moral panic thing. What we need is messaging to say I would 100% be a neuro link hacker. But if any government officials are listening in, I&rsquo;m definitely joking. So he&rsquo;s in. The clear, yeah. Thank you. DJ Leo, I think this has been very informative. We&rsquo;ve, we&rsquo;ve, we&rsquo;ve ended on such an exciting note in terms of bio engineering and hacking that we&rsquo;ll have to pick that up at a future point.
Leo
Fire.
Craig
Any bio hacker people out? There, feel free to message in 0488811707. Or catch us up on our socials. You can reach out to media mothership on its Facebook page. It&rsquo;s Instagram page. It has a website mediamothership.aunoisthatwrongwhatdidi-say.com.org.org I think. Well, that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s edgeradiois.org dot AU. Yeah, I&rsquo;m not on org though.
Taylor
Well.
Speaker 5
Tonight.
Leo
Tom.
Craig
I don&rsquo;t think I got to come either anyway.
Taylor
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. You are just dot AU because, yeah, you hopped onto that train.
Craig
All the best sheriffs.
Taylor
And nobody else did.
Craig
Fashion. That&rsquo;s distinctive. Listening next week on Media Mothership where we explore. I don&rsquo;t know. I don&rsquo;t know. Knight Rider I&rsquo;m thinking 1980s knight.
Taylor
Rider no, I haven&rsquo;t. Seen that, yeah. The office.
Craig
Thanks. Thanks listeners for listening in Big Boy 80 and so forth. Yeah, maybe yours. And if people are interested in what Leah has been saying, listening on Tuesdays at 11:00 live to.
Leo
You can message Anne. I can answer any questions.
Craig
Hyper fixation sensation. Any other way people can reach out to you?
Leo
Yeah, we haven&rsquo;t finished Ram. I don&rsquo;t know what it is because my co-host Jen runs it. She&rsquo;s my support worker. Do we have any shows?
Craig
After this, no.
Leo
No, that&rsquo;s cool. Yeah. I want to show mum the setup.
Craig
Yeah, there&rsquo;s a lot of junk on the table at the moment. As people will see on the street. All right. Well, thanks everyone for listening and this would be meeting mothership for another week. Doctor Craig joined by Mordecai Taylor, Magister Taylor and GJ.
Leo
Magistrate.
