Craig
All right, welcome to. Media mothership here on Edge radio. 99.3 FM.
Speaker
Seth.
Craig
Seth Rollins, that. The through, you know, I&rsquo;m just gonna mash up and put wrestling ends in.
Marcus
I&rsquo;m OK with that. I mean, Seth Rollins is a good person.
Craig
To start with, it is unfortunately he&rsquo;s not in the studio as always, I&rsquo;m host Craig joined by Co host Taylor. Hey, special guest. So and we&rsquo;re breaking down Summer Slam 2025 and various major events recently in the. World of WWE as well. Right. We&rsquo;ll get around to Hulk Hogan, maybe and. The rest will be a surprise as Mark&rsquo;s mind wanders.
Taylor
John Cena.
Craig
Cena.
Marcus
We can&rsquo;t see him.
Craig
Let&rsquo;s start with overall thoughts of what you thought of summer in 25. What what is it is it? Is it a really key moment in the wrestling calendar?
Marcus
Summer Slam is considered the second most important. Premium live event of the year by WWE after Wrestle Mania Mania. Some people actually call it hot wrestle Mania because WrestleMania is on during early spring and summer. Slam is on during late summer.
Speaker
Yes.
Marcus
Over there. Obviously not over here. It&rsquo;s called the biggest part of the summer. And when, when my friends and I watched it, we were all rugged. Up in hoodies and puffer. Jackets. It was pretty good. It was the first ever two night summer slam because usually a premium live event only goes for one night, but because the roster the WWE has right now is really stacked.
Craig
Right, Yep.
Marcus
And Triple H she does the booking. Doesn&rsquo;t like doing 5 minute throw away matches. They have to cause most of the matches will go for around at least 10 minutes. The main event of night two this year went for well over 35 minutes so.
Craig
And is that long? Is that is it was the main event was considered? Kind of like a a great match. 35 minutes.
Marcus
Ohh, people thought this was great, so the main event of summer Slam 2025 was John Cena versus Cody Rhodes 2. Their first matches at WrestleMania and it wasn&rsquo;t very good because it&rsquo;s John Cena&rsquo;s retirement year and his final year as a wrestler. He turned heel, which means he became a villain at the start of the year because that&rsquo;s something he hasn&rsquo;t done in over 20 years. And he wanted to do that before he retired, and it was just a very odd. Ron and had some very mediocre matches.
Craig
Yes, right, right. Because it&rsquo;s so as you&rsquo;re saying, it&rsquo;s come to an end now, right, that he&rsquo;ll run.
Marcus
Yeah. And there was no, there was no great moment where he did a really heroic action. He just came out and smacked down one day, said he didn&rsquo;t want to be a bad guy anymore. And literally that was it. And yeah, it it&rsquo;s a really awkward promo because Cody&rsquo;s in the ring.
Craig
Really.
Speaker
That&rsquo;s the reason.
Marcus
Who is the the main guy right now? He lost the championship to senior and he got at WrestleMania, got it back at summer. Plan, but seeing it comes out has this long and rambling monologue about how someone pressured me into turning evil because he thought it would be good TV. The rock, the rock, Dwayne Johnson who influenced a lot of the storylines up until sort of March of this year and then just vanished. Without a trace.
Craig
Is there a reason why he&rsquo;s vanished? Is there much speculation as to what went down there?
Marcus
Two things. One is that Dwayne Johnson obviously has a really loaded schedule because not only is he an actor, but he also runs multiple businesses and he runs his own product. Company and as Marco Pierre White once said, you cannot criticise a man for going to work.
Taylor
But it&rsquo;s a good quote. It is a good.
Marcus
Quote but also so the the chief content Officer, Triple H who does the booking of WWE right now. He and the rock and don&rsquo;t get along. They haven&rsquo;t gotten along for the 30 years they&rsquo;ve known each other. They&rsquo;re not friends. They don&rsquo;t enjoy working together. And now that Triple H is and the main guy in head of Creative and Dwayne Johnson&rsquo;s the on the board of directors, they clash. And I think the rock just took his ball and.
Craig
Went home. Yeah, right. So. So the sense is that part of John Cena&rsquo;s heel turn heel. Babyface, move. Now is, is that this is an indication that the rocks influences gone gone.
Speaker
Yeah.
Marcus
Thank goodness, because it was. Everyone keeps waiting for him to turn up and he there&rsquo;s no word from him. They haven&rsquo;t even. Him, but the rematch was really good and it was it. It actually starts out with a really brilliant and subtle bit of storytelling, because the basis of seeing his heel turn was that he was going to ruin wrestling. And so instead of the regular like red, white and blue lights in the caricature of him saluting the comes up on the big screen when he does his entrance for the real run, it was just black text.
Craig
Right.
Marcus
Very black screen white text John Cena to indicate he&rsquo;s not messy. Going around, but when he made his interest summer slam, it starts with the black, the black background, the white text and then boom, the lights come up. It&rsquo;s red, white and blue. There&rsquo;s the character of him saluting, and the crowd absolutely exploded. They were so happy to have him as.
Craig
A good guy again caught everyone.
Marcus
By surprise, it didn&rsquo;t catch any everyone by surprise. I think that that decision. Because people were sort of umming and arring after Smackdown going. Is this real or is he actually gonna be a good guy again? But no, no, he&rsquo;s back as a good guy. And so and the rematch with Cody was excellent. It was a street fight. So notice qualifications, no countouts only win by pinfall or sub. Mission and it went with well over 35 minutes. They actually destroyed part of the ring trying to do damage to each other. There was no blood, which I thought was surprising. They had a really good brawl all throughout the the audience that went through the backstage area. There&rsquo;s this brilliant part where there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s an elevator that lifts Cody up as part of his entrance. Seeing a pounds on coat, he hoists him over his shoulders for his finishing move. The attitude adjustment and then goes backstage and comes out of the elevator with Cody still over his shoulders and this demonic grin and. Space. There&rsquo;s just a lot of really good camera movements and just a lot of really good character work as well. The body language of the guys was excellent, seen as body language, as a wrestler is one of his greatest assets because for, for, for years and years and years when he was doing his full time run, the audience would chant at him. You can&rsquo;t wrestle. You can&rsquo;t wrestle, but the way that he carries himself in his body language and his facial expressions are really good at communicating character and telling a story. And that was really on display in.
Craig
The straight fight, it still surprises me. The return to baby face happening so soon, because part of the excitement I guess for John scenes departure was this drama. Attic shift into a bad guy and that this was going to potentially. I mean there were a lot of speculation as how big this could become. You know, could it mean that all the wrestling titles are going to get taken by Cena and he&rsquo;ll he&rsquo;ll have to reset them or something?
Marcus
Or it would have been an interesting story that to follow, he could have unified. Onto the belts, but ultimately, you know, he&rsquo;s been a heel for five months. There&rsquo;s been a lot of discourse online about whether or not it&rsquo;s worked. If anyone&rsquo;s unfamiliar, wrestling is all. It&rsquo;s all scripted entertainment that presents itself. Being it it ohh, it&rsquo;s basically it. It&rsquo;s acknowledged as but as as as as a work of fiction outside of the outside of the premium live events and the TV shows with the TV shows and the premium live events still aren&rsquo;t operate under that mask grade, which is called kayfabe. And ultimately people are not buying it out of universe. They&rsquo;re not buying in and doing, they&rsquo;re still cheering him. He&rsquo;s been a hill. He was a hill for five months and he&rsquo;s only got about 5 months left.
Craig
Yeah. Before he&rsquo;s gone forever. So because you had a couple of memes that were getting generated by the Sinner, he&rsquo;ll turn the little boy. Who was crestfallen but loved being what was the story about the little boy right? He was like one of the events early on with seen as he&rsquo;ll turn.
Marcus
He was a kid in Brussels at the very front row, wearing in John Cena T shirt and John Cena hat, and it&rsquo;s just after the heel turn and seen it calls him out as part of because he comes out and goes. I&rsquo;ve been in an abusive relationship with all of you. People and he singles the kid out and then they just shot at the kid with his mouth hanging open and just staring like a deer in the headlights. And they actually found the kid in interview afterwards. He was like, look, I&rsquo;m aware that this is.
Craig
That&rsquo;s right.
Marcus
All scripted. I thought it was really cool that he involved me in the story.
Craig
And again, yeah, so it was the sense of really generating it. It&rsquo;s a huge impact. And again if if you&rsquo;re listening out there, feel free to send us a message on 0488811707. We&rsquo;re talking with our special guest Marcus about the Summer Slam 2025. We have a message in. On. Steam no one. What is? What is the chat?
Marcus
Steam steam Chat, my favourite messaging service.
Craig
What is that an image of I think.
Taylor
Isn&rsquo;t that YouTube? Yeah.
Craig
That&rsquo;s. OK YouTube. Chat. Are we playing a game by Big Boy Natty? Thanks, Big Boy needy listening in, he says. Good evening, doctor Craig TT.
Taylor
Yeah, that&rsquo;s maybe.
Craig
OK, that&rsquo;s you and special guest Marcus. Listening was playing cyberpunk. Well, I I think this will help. There&rsquo;s no wrestling in Cyberpunk 2070.
Speaker
Wow.
Taylor
7 There&rsquo;s straight fights.
Craig
In fight. Oh, that&rsquo;s. Right, yes you can. You can do street fighting. Yeah. So we&rsquo;re breaking down WrestleMania 2025. Have jumped in, I guess at one of the surprise favourite moment. Elements of night 2, but which is the Cody Rhodes and John Cena? They&rsquo;re both baby faces now. So what&rsquo;s the inward explanation of two baby faces fighting each other?
Marcus
They were fighting over the undisputed belt, which is seen as the most prestigious belt in the company, because Cody is still a full timer and he wants the belt back because he went through so much to get it in universe and out of universe as well and it was orange case if he wanted it back. And there&rsquo;s a brilliant moment and it it&rsquo;s made clear throughout the throughout the fight that it&rsquo;s not.
Speaker
Used to be.
Marcus
It&rsquo;s not personal it they just. It&rsquo;s just who&rsquo;s gonna be the real top dog. And there&rsquo;s a brilliant moment near the end where a big part of Cody&rsquo;s story in universe is he has to learn to be less soft and less forgiving. And there&rsquo;s a brilliant bit where he and I&rsquo;ve never seen this done before. He undoes Part 1 of the one of the ring. I don&rsquo;t even know. Like, like he full on takes a turn. Buckle off the ring and still attached to the ropes, and he starts bludgeoning. Tina with it, really. And the audience was actually booing him for cause. That&rsquo;s such a heel tactic, but it was very much a case. So I have to do whatever it takes to win. But there&rsquo;s a brilliant moment where he hits a bunch of his signature moves on scene and realises that he&rsquo;s about to pin scene her and put him down for good and.
Craig
What are the names of the signature moves?
Marcus
So for Cody, it&rsquo;s one of them is the Cody Carter where he jumps off, he runs towards and jumps off the second rope. And as he&rsquo;s as he&rsquo;s falling, he sort of grabs the other guys head and drops them to the mat.
Craig
The Cody cutter.
Marcus
Yeah, which is similar to the diamond cutter, which is DDP&rsquo;s signature. And the RKO, which is Randy Orton signature. Yeah, he also does the crossroads where he sort of hooks the other guys head underneath his armpit. So they&rsquo;re bent backwards at the knees and sort of flips around. So they slam the head on the mat. There&rsquo;s also the flip flop and fly, which is one of his dad&rsquo;s moves.
Craig
Flip flop and fly.
Marcus
Why? It&rsquo;s basically a bunch of a bunch of close range punches and then starts with him sort of spinning his hands like he&rsquo;s doing a disco dance from his knees as he bends over to the knees. Does that stands up, adjusts his head and then box them with an elbow? Oh gosh, flip the flip flop and fly.
Taylor
Flip flop and fly. Yeah, I knew it was slip, slop and slap.
Craig
Whoops. Slap, slap. See.
Marcus
Both really good marketing campaigns.
Speaker
Yeah.
Marcus
Those are those are the three big ones that you see in every Cody Rhodes.
Craig
And so you&rsquo;re describing a scene in the the match with Scener and Rhodes, where he is roads is doing his signature moves.
Marcus
Yeah. So he the to the, the, the climax of the match. He&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s hit them all scene is. Clearly staggered.
Craig
And I guess the crowds reacting to that as they&rsquo;re seeing these signature moves, each one of those is kind of narratively placed to to create heat or audience engagement. And so Sinner is. Is kind of receiving these moves, and the audiences, the audience.
Marcus
Cody is an interesting one because usually because the the the WWE audience is interesting in that the people, usually the they always dislike the current guy. They almost always dislike the current guy ever since. Yeah, ever since John Cena became the guy in the early 2000&rsquo;s, The people who were going to see him.
Craig
Everything&rsquo;s like the belt holder.
Marcus
Who had the disposable income to pay to go and see senior matches had grown up watching Brett Hart Stone cold and the rock, and they were the three guys. They loved and Sena was not like any of them. And so they would Boo him because they didn&rsquo;t like the way that he was portrayed as a, as a, as a as a hero. They didn&rsquo;t like his style, so they would just he&rsquo;d walk in and they would just absolutely Boo him out of the building. But now, because seeing was always be with kids watching at home. So now the people who are going to the stadiums to see the matches. People who were kids when they watched John Cena 10/15/20 years ago and so now they Boo whoever seen her as fighting cause they he&rsquo;s their childhood hero.
Craig
It&rsquo;s like the attack of the clones movie, you know? Ohh maybe Phantom menace, right? Absolutely horrible movies from ******** Star Wars. And but that was the movie The kids grew up with, and now it&rsquo;s a cherished part of Star Wars, which gets re released.
Marcus
Yeah.
Speaker
Really.
Taylor
I. Even though I thought everyone hated it matter who they were.
Craig
Not not young kids. I mean, I think that was aimed at.
Marcus
8 year olds I I loved phantom menace when I saw it in this and it. Was a nine year old I.
Craig
Saw it twice, right, see and and it&rsquo;s in this nice, warm nostalgic place. Now, if it&rsquo;s at the movies as a.
Marcus
Relaunch or I will say I&rsquo;ve never liked to tackle the clones though. I&rsquo;ve. Always found that. Boring start now, yeah.
Taylor
Me too.
Craig
Come to the converted here.
Marcus
But something that&rsquo;s something to note is that is that Cody is the first guy who&rsquo;s actually like being an organic baby face, who the crowd actually likes because he usually gets the really big cheers like everyone sings, sings his theme song. They get behind everything that he does. They&rsquo;re always cheering for like. Nuts for him. Because from sort of 2002 to him coming back in 2022. The main guys were people who Vince McMahon, the former owner, would just push. He just didn&rsquo;t care what the audience thought cause he was a strange and odd dude, and we have something to say about him in a little bit. A strange and odd dude who just hated his audience for some reason I thought they.
Craig
Were all idiots, but Vince McMahon is the is is the godfather of.
Taylor
The son of the Godfather.
Craig
The space, the sound of it, yeah.
Marcus
Really. No. He McMahon like McMahon. Senior ran a successful run, a successful territory.
Craig
Because we&rsquo;re talking here about the managers and bosses, yeah.
Marcus
Junior.
Craig
Of wrestling, WWF, WWE.
Marcus
Yeah. Insane. You run a run a successful territory, Vince Junior. Who was that? That guy ran a successful global takeover.
Taylor
Fair.
Marcus
Vincent Vincent. Major is human scum. He&rsquo;s an atrocious human being, personally. But he did succeed in making the.
Craig
Bought out.
Marcus
Ohh yeah. Ohh yeah, the one where he&rsquo;s like in tears when he&rsquo;s being asked about what? His what his friendship with. The undertaking. Means he&rsquo;s. Yeah. Because because, well, because. Because he was horribly abused as a kid. He hates any involuntary bodily function. So he hates crying because he can&rsquo;t control it. He&rsquo;s fired people for sneezing in front of him. He hates anything you can&rsquo;t control.
Craig
Gosh, seems like an episode of succession or something.
Marcus
Pretty much is, but there was a really controversial moment from the end of the end of the match, or just after the.
Craig
Match rather. Yep, this is Day 2, the Cody versus. Seen a match.
Marcus
Yes. So it ends with Cody gets the pin. After saluting scene. It looks really sad. He salutes him cause like they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re friends in real life. They&rsquo;re friends in the fictional.
Craig
Saluting Cena. That&rsquo;s.
Speaker
Yeah.
Marcus
Universe and it&rsquo;s like he wants his belt back. He doesn&rsquo;t want his friend, so he pins him. He gets the belt back. There&rsquo;s tears. They hug scene. It gives him the belt. Seen her motions to Cody for the audience to applaud for him. Cody gets out of the ring and let&rsquo;s see now have his moment. The audience is chanting. Thank you, Cena. But then. A wrestler who was one of seen his big rivals throughout his career, his music hits and he comes out and it&rsquo;s Brock Lesnar who? OK. So Vince Junior, who we just talked about who ran WWE for about 4045 years, had to resign because he&rsquo;s being investigated by the feds for running a sex trafficking. Yes, and Brock Lesnar was 100% complicit in that. And there are text messages confirming this and he he&rsquo;s mysteriously disappeared after Mania after summer Slam 2023 with we&rsquo;d never seen him again. And Brock Lesnar comes out and he&rsquo;s here to have one last match against Cena later in the year, and that has inspired opinions online.
Craig
Wow. Yeah. I mean, that&rsquo;s a really. The toxic move to bring.
Marcus
That&rsquo;s someone you do not want, especially considering how many women are in the WWE right now like they&rsquo;re women&rsquo;s roster is the biggest it&rsquo;s ever been. You do not want someone who is involved in a human trafficking organisation. It&rsquo;s difficult to be a wrestling fan at the moment because of stuff like that.
Craig
So who&rsquo;s the who&rsquo;s the target audience for this? I mean, this would have to have gone through some marketing to decide. Alright, well, let&rsquo;s bring. Back he&rsquo;s got the right wing neo-Nazi audience.
Marcus
My my understanding is my understanding is that it was done as a favour to John Cena because Cena Cassina enjoyed working with Brock Lesnar throughout his career and so my understanding is that he&rsquo;s actually requested that Lesnar come back so he can have.
Speaker
Really.
Marcus
One last last match again.
Craig
Even with the bad PR optics I.
Marcus
Could be very wrong. I could be very wrong but. That that&rsquo;s my understanding.
Craig
No. So these, they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re. Yeah. So there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s juicy behind the scenes. Debates and conspiracy.
Taylor
And and for people at home who haven&rsquo;t seen Brock Lesnar, he looks kind of like if he had fantastic fours. The thing as just a human, that&rsquo;s him.
Marcus
If you were to cover if you were to cover a tree like an oak tree trunk in shaved ham, that&rsquo;s Brock Lesnar.
Craig
Wow. Wow. So yeah, look, I mean, it is. It&rsquo;s surprising then that that this, this, I mean polarising figure or this.
Marcus
Seems polarising cause people who grew up watching him are like, yeah, Brock Lesnar&rsquo;s back. And then people who are aware that he is involved in an ongoing human trafficking.
Craig
Just like.
Marcus
It&rsquo;s like, why would you bring him back? That&rsquo;s a really bad. That&rsquo;s bad. Pay off. And they&rsquo;ve they&rsquo;ve gotten bad PR as a result. It&rsquo;s really upsetting.
Craig
Well this I. Mean. I mean, I mean, there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s been some discussion of the the overlap between the Trump administration and WWE. Maybe this is just part of being on the the bandwagon of trying to dig yourself out of implications with sex.
Marcus
Trafficking. Well, I mean, Trump is a WWE Hall of Famer, so I mean, obviously the standards are low.
Craig
By being a Hall of Fame, what does that mean? He&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s a photo of him in a museum. The wrestling museum, yeah.
Marcus
No, he&rsquo;s well, he&rsquo;s been stunned by Stone Cold Steve Austin so that he&rsquo;s technically been he&rsquo;s been part of wrestling manoeuvres. But yeah, so the Hall of Fame happens every year at WrestleMania. Basically. They induct people, they get updated with speech. There&rsquo;s a video package celebrating their life and accomplishments. And yeah, Trump&rsquo;s. A Hall of Famer, he got inducted a few years.
Craig
Ago and that would be like a university giving an honorary degree to Shane Warne or something, right? Like it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a way of.
Marcus
Absolutely.
Craig
Of of ensuring political links as well as. You know real. Wrestlers being recognised, but it also has a heavy political. Space. It&rsquo;s wrestling, right wing, conservative.
Marcus
It would be it&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s a that&rsquo;s a. That&rsquo;s a question there have been periods where it&rsquo;s been extremely conservative. So during the war.
Craig
Or.
Marcus
Terror. They had a character played by an Italian American called Mohammed Hassan. One who wears extremely stereotypical Middle Eastern clothing and his he was he. He was a bad guy. No, not not the Sheikh, it&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s the farmer from the Sheikh. He was playing a character who was he was a villain cause he was upset at how much anti Islamic sentiment there was following the War on Terror. And that&rsquo;s why he was a bad guy. And so a lot of people these days pretend that that never happened. There have been a lot of really questionable depictions of LGBTQIA plus people. The character gold dust was basically created to tap into gay panic in the mid to late 1990.
Craig
Wow. So at the height of the AIDS crisis, height, but certainly within that.
Marcus
Yeah, well. They have this very androgynous character in a body suit who licks his lips and lusts openly, lusts after the other men on the roster, and it&rsquo;s just.
Craig
Well, your decade was.
Marcus
That nine this was like 969798, it&rsquo;s.
Craig
Right, right, right.
Taylor
Has Joe Biden in the Hall of Fame? Has he ever had an attitude adjustment?
Craig
Are there any? Yeah, left wing progressive.
Marcus
Ohh look though, I mean Mohammed Mohammed Ali is in the the Hall of Fame.
Craig
The wrestling. Yeah, right.
Marcus
Because he&rsquo;s he was the I think he was a guest enforcer, the guest ring announcer? No, the I think it was a referee for the for main event. Marissa Mania 1. He was involved in that.
Speaker
See.
Taylor
Yeah, it&rsquo;s good referee. Yeah.
Craig
Because Hulk Hogan. Of course, notoriously at the end of his life, promoted and campaigned for Trump. Yep, and a lot of that came up in his obituaries as a some people head scratching kind of identity shift. So within these, did you?
Marcus
Just just on the note of that, after Hulk Hogan passed away, the Wrestling Observer newsletter, which is seen as being sort of the foremost weekly publication wrestling in the world, the the the week he passed away, they did a Life and Times issue and the following week they actually reported on some of the responses his death had gotten online. Because Hulk Hogan was, he was recorded saying some extremely racist things that got leaked, and he&rsquo;s also, you know, a Trump supporter, A notorious backstage politicker. Obviously, he helped make wrestling really big in the 80s, but also.
Speaker
So.
Marcus
Generally speaking, bit of a sketchy guy, scrappy, strange, strange history with his family and basically anyone who said any public figure who said anything about Hulk Hogan would get criticised by someone in the weeks after he passed away. If you were progressive and you said that he had a complicated legacy because of his racism and the way he treated his family, you&rsquo;d get flamed by his fans saying you don&rsquo;t know your wrestling history, there wouldn&rsquo;t be a WrestleMania.
Taylor
Yeah, here&rsquo;s a moustache.
Marcus
If it wasn&rsquo;t for him, whereas if he was lauded by people who are mega fans and appreciated things that he done done for the the the industry, then you&rsquo;d have progressives saying he was a racist. Then he was a political and he was terrible to his family. You you. You shouldn&rsquo;t be celebrating his accomplishments. And I&rsquo;m. I&rsquo;m not saying that either of those are correct or incorrect statements, but he just the amount of vitriol that was directed towards anyone who said anything about him in the weeks following his death was astounding.
Speaker
Hmm.
Taylor
That he&rsquo;s just Twitter as well.
Marcus
Twitter. Some some people actually got some people got bullied off social media like Joey Swoll, who&rsquo;s thing is he&rsquo;s on Instagram and he basically tries to have really positive messages to people and tried to dispel, like any toxic beliefs said that he was a huge fan of Hulk Hogan and people flamed him with within an inch of his life. And he actually quit Instagram for a few days.
Taylor
Yeah.
Speaker
Next.
Marcus
Like I can&rsquo;t take it. Gun.
Craig
Because he said he was a.
Marcus
Fan because he said he was a fan of Hulk Hogan growing up.
Craig
And the backlash to that?
Marcus
Was from, from, from, from progressives who were like he was a racist. He was a terrible human. You can&rsquo;t say stuff like this.
Craig
Because I guess one of the other aspects of Hulk Hogan&rsquo;s past I&rsquo;d forgotten about was his involvement in the Gorka. The scandal with the sex tape and how that complete I&rsquo;ve forgotten about the media systems that basically dismantled the payout was huge. Yeah, I forget how.
Marcus
Ohh yeah. Many it was 115,000,000 that the courts ordered to him. He I think he I believe he settled for 32,000,000.
Craig
Millions, but. And I&rsquo;m 15 really well. Because it was a defamation case, I imagine, and it was because they&rsquo;d.
Speaker
Yeah.
Craig
Used the sex footage that had leaked, OK.
Marcus
I believe it was the footage of him saying how much he hates African Americans that.
Craig
Got leaked? Ohh right it was. That. And anyway, that that that resulted in the collapse of that media platform and that rippled throughout a lot of other platforms. Even Kotaku, you know that there was not a, Kotaku told the journalist, was just saying, you know. He was there, involved not in Gawker but adjacent media publishing company, and was shocked at the ripples that created. So OK. That&rsquo;s Hulk Hogan, so storyline. So we&rsquo;ve we&rsquo;ve gone through a little bit of the storylines in terms of. Sena. What are some of the ongoing storylines which are are kind of becoming compelling at the moment or which we&rsquo;re seeing emerge now or or getting wrapped?
Marcus
Up one story that&rsquo;s had a a a curveball that was really well done is so the whole. The the Seth Rollins CM Punk feud, which has been going off and on since CM Punk came back in late 2023. For reference, CM Punk is someone who was he? He left WWE in 2014 under a cloud of controversy, spent the next nine years saying very negative things about them and then was welcomed back with open arms. Seth Rollins, basically. That the ball from him is being one of the top guys and has never had a nice thing to say about punk in real life or in kayfabe. And essentially, there&rsquo;s a story been going on between them for a while now. They had they had a triple threat match at WrestleMania, which ended with Seth Rollins turning heel. Even the audience loves him, became a bad guy, and he started his own faction called The Vision. And this is brilliant. So they so LA night, who was another guy who people. Really like him. And it&rsquo;s really it&rsquo;s basically do or die time either because he&rsquo;s 42, he&rsquo;s not getting any younger either they. No, he&rsquo;s 40. Sorry. Either they strap the rocket to him and make him one of the top guys or he&rsquo;s gonna flounder in the mid kite for forever cause even though.
Speaker
Right.
Marcus
Wrestling is premeditated. People only have so much time that they can be in the main event, and it&rsquo;s got you&rsquo;ve gotta capitalise because it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s week to week. There is no offseason for wrestling and he&rsquo;s he challenged Seth Rollins to a match at Saturday night&rsquo;s main event and during the match Seth has a history of knee injuries. He did WrestleMania last year on a torn meniscus. He was working on one leg and he had two matches across the weekend, plus a run in and then he had several months off for surgery during the match at Saturday night&rsquo;s main event.
Craig
Ouch.
Marcus
Broadcast live on NBC because normally wrestling&rsquo;s done either on a streaming service or cable, he does his knee and he very and this is brilliant. He he he injured his knee. He looks terrified and he very clearly motions over to the referee and you can clearly see him telling her go and tell Ellie night to pin me. Done my knee. I can&rsquo;t keep doing the match. So he&rsquo;s called. He&rsquo;s called an audible. That&rsquo;s what that&rsquo;s called. Because if you can&rsquo;t continue with the match, you&rsquo;ve got to communicate to the other person and say, here&rsquo;s what we have to do. And so Seth Rollins is then on crutches. There&rsquo;s word he&rsquo;s gonna be out for six or seven months. And here&rsquo;s the thing. Seth Rollins won money in the bank, which basically means that if you have the money, the bank briefcase whenever you want, you can open it and you can, if you pin the tile, you can. You can get an immediate title match no matter where you are or where you are. And it&rsquo;s always done on TV, even though there&rsquo;s so many other hours in the week because it&rsquo;s WWE and. Their their universe is interesting, but essentially so. There was talk about how how they&rsquo;re going to do this when he&rsquo;s going to be out until next year. Yeah. And then there&rsquo;s much the night 1 main event is CM Punk, his rival versus Gunther dead in general, whose thing is that? He&rsquo;s Hitler. And he Gunther has the World Heavyweight Championship, which is the main belt on Roy. It&rsquo;s the secondary world title of the promotion. And it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s an exhausting.
Speaker
MHM.
Marcus
Match Punk is on his knees, gassed for most of it, and it&rsquo;s clearly done in storyline that he&rsquo;s really exhausted fighting Gunther and he basically, Gunther&rsquo;s only been pinned 3 times in the since he&rsquo;s gone to W. Anyway, and he punk basically makes him bleed for the first time he sends him over the announcers desk. Good. That comes back with his face covered in blood, cause he&rsquo;s done a. Really impressive blade. Job play Joe Punk gets him back in the ring, pins him clean as a whistle. He&rsquo;s got the World Heavyweight championship. It&rsquo;s his moment and then Seth theme music hits Seth.
Craig
&lsquo;S right.
Marcus
Comes out on crutches, throws the crutches away, undoes his leg brace, prances around, pulls out his briefcase, sprints to the ring, pins punk for the 123 and now says the. Heavyweight champion. And the following Rd. The first person to come out and start mouthing off during during a word battle and challenge for a title fight is Ella. Knight. That guy who he injured his knee again to quote unquote. And they have a match later that night that ends in his qualification cause CM Punk gets involved. So this whole punk and LA night are both going after Seth and they are going to feud with each other at. Some point soon.
Craig
Right. Wow.
Marcus
And this storyline is juicy. This has been probably the second best storyline of the year in my estimate, because it&rsquo;s been going for so long through so many permutations. There are so many people involved. The faction that that&rsquo;s built is brilliant the other.
Speaker
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Marcus
Man, sorry. So that&rsquo;s that. And that&rsquo;s really cool. This other thing, which is really funny, is that one of the other top guys, Roman Reigns, he he&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s often out for months at a time. 1 of Seth henchman. Bronson Reed hits this, he he he speared Roman Reigns so hard in an episode of RAW that Roman Reigns his. Shoes came off.
Craig
That means I think. You&rsquo;ve.
Marcus
Died. And then what he does is Bronson Reed, who&rsquo;s a villain. Roman Reigns is a good guy. Bronson Reed steals these really nice Air Jordans, ties the laces together, and he starts wearing them around his neck. And because Roman Reigns, he&rsquo;s Samoan. He was. His role was the try, his his character with the tribal chief who&rsquo;s got this really nice red shell necklace called the ULA Fala. And so now Bronson Reed with these stolen shoes wears them around his neck, and they&rsquo;re the Shula Fala and the audience chants at him and everything. And it&rsquo;s brilliant.
Craig
Crazy.
Marcus
And so just just the fact that a pair of air. Ordnance has become this massive symbol of disrespect is.
Craig
Brilliant. And that would be a real. Surprise movement shoes flying off.
Speaker
Yes.
Craig
And then the wrestler being able to improvise a total amount of that.
Marcus
I don&rsquo;t know if it was improvised or not because people, but I mean people have been actually knocked out of their shoes before, so it wouldn&rsquo;t surprise me, but they had A tag match. Bronson Reed, sorry. Bronson Reed and Roman Reigns had a match against each other with other people involved at at summer slam. It was also really good. Lot of comedy in that match. There&rsquo;s a lot of really good comedy in WWE.
Craig
Right.
Marcus
Right now, but the yeah, the the punk night, Rollins conflicts coming out of me is one of the best ones. That that was a really enjoyable moment, and especially because they had played this fake injury, cause they&rsquo;re usually very clear. They&rsquo;re usually very clear about what is fake and what is real. It&rsquo;s.
Craig
Yeah, right. Someone was playing as.
Marcus
Just. Real they were playing it as real because people have been injured and they&rsquo;ve had to just stop batches this year and some, like there&rsquo;s one where I think it&rsquo;s Zoe Stark comes off a rope. The person she&rsquo;s called out to has noticed and she lands, finding her knees pointing a different angle. Uh. That was against.
Craig
Again and again the the wrestler would get the referee to help communicate.
Marcus
Yes, thankfully that was a triple threat match. So she left the other two kept on brawling and then and that was that was Kyrie saying who was involved in that. And then a couple weeks later, Kyrie saying having a match against Liv Morgan does a perfectly safe headlock. Take down and live. Morgan dislocates her shoulder. And so poor old Kyrie saying has now injured two people in the space of a fortnight and she. So they&rsquo;re both out of the rest of the year. So and because Seth&rsquo;s knee problems, his real life knee problems are so well documented that everyone thought it was real, I thought it was real. I got sucker. We got worked, brother. And so the fact that they were able to, he actually talked about in interviews about how he had to, because he was obviously he was fine at home. He&rsquo;s got a four year old daughter and he said to his daughter, we have to pretend that daddy&rsquo;s got a Boo Boo on his knee. Every I gotta make believe people need to believe this. So of course she immediately went to play school and told her teacher. About it.
Craig
And my dad said we have to make out. My dad&rsquo;s going to. What did you mean by you got worked? Is that a wrestling parlance for effectively being?
Marcus
As in. In, in wrestling work is, it&rsquo;s part of the script. Shoot is. It&rsquo;s real, right?
Craig
So by saying you&rsquo;re worked it was. A scripted moment.
Marcus
And we believed it.
Craig
That it it played as real and it was designed to play as real effectively, but it was actually setting up key fabe, yes. Lane story building. Because yes, that that would be fantastic. I&rsquo;m on the other storylines. How&rsquo;s the Australian talent?
Marcus
Ohh Ria bloody Ripley.
Craig
Because she was on night 1.
Speaker
Some.
Marcus
She was she opened night two night and and ah, because you know that triple threat match from the side of night 2 of WrestleMania earlier in the year. Yes. Similar thing where. She had an absolute bond burner at evolution, which was the second all women&rsquo;s premium life. And against the then world champion EO Sky that ends in Naomi, who had money, the bank major villain comes out, cashes in, gets CEO&rsquo;s title because they&rsquo;re doing this whole bit about how Rio Ripley&rsquo;s Rio Ripley has never beaten Neo Sky, and she still hasn&rsquo;t.
Craig
Right. Sky right. That&rsquo;s the Japanese wrestler.
Marcus
Yes, considered one of the great and. Man ohh sorry I have to have a little rant here. I understand that the the last 40 minutes has not been nothing but me ranting, but Triple H is really bad at booking champions to defend their titles. So there was a brilliant story just before Mania where here sky Beats Rear Ripley for the belt on raw. Very rare to see. A well titled Change Hands on an episode of TV. Usually it&rsquo;s a premium live. Based on in Kayfabe, a match that Ria suggested, she then defends it the following week and then she successfully everyone thought because there was a triple threat. Osmania with RIA and iOS Sky and another wrestler, Bianca Bel Air, everyone thought EO Sky was going to lose it cause she was the 3rd wheel on the feud. Everyone was disrespecting her. She pulls out this incredible win five Star match from the Wrestling Observer newsletter. Brilliant. Feel good. Brilliant. Feel good moment. She then does not defend the belt once.
Craig
Well, it&rsquo;s like.
Marcus
Between late April and when she loses it in mid July.
Craig
Really so just wasted storyline.
Marcus
Completely all there are so many women on that roster who she could have had really good title defences against, even if it&rsquo;s only on TV and not on Premier Live event, but they just didn&rsquo;t do it. She had non title matches, she was in tag team matches but they just didn&rsquo;t.
Craig
I know you&rsquo;ve mentioned in the past that you know Vince McMahon never knew what to do with someone who didn&rsquo;t speak English effectively as a wrestler. Is that partially to do with it still, sadly.
Marcus
Yeah. Or I wouldn&rsquo;t. I wouldn&rsquo;t say so. Because she&rsquo;s had incredible. She&rsquo;s had she, her previous world title run, which was a last year. It went for the best part of eight months. That was actually really good. And she had a number of feuds, feuds rather, and another of the new, one of the there are a couple of talent at the moment who aren&rsquo;t native English speakers, but one of the biggest wrestlers right now, Stephanie Vaquer. She was on NXT, which is the developmental brand, she&rsquo;s Chilean. She doesn&rsquo;t speak much English, but she had a really good run.
Speaker
Hmm.
Marcus
On as champion, actually a double champion, she had the world title and the North American title, so that&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s definitely.
Craig
Because it is. Changed. Yeah, it is exciting with the kind of lucha Libre style from Mexico and then the Japanese wrestling style. So, so definitely giving those global wrestling identities. Coverage in WWE can&rsquo;t help but benefit it, but yeah, it is. Unfortunate that. So anyway, in summer slam there was the match with rear and ear. And was that a good match was.
Marcus
That good? Yes, it was. Rear versus euro versus Naomi, who&rsquo;s sort of the main villain of the women&rsquo;s division at the moment. It was a good triple threat match. Naomi retained because she has a match against Stephanie.
Speaker
It was.
Marcus
Occur at the care at Clash in Paris later. This month and. If Stephanie occurs A babyface, people really like her. If you were to have her go against Rhea Ripley, people would start to Boo her, so she has to go against a mega heel so that people still like her. It&rsquo;s an interesting I actually got to thinking though, because they&rsquo;re gonna have crown jewel, one of the major premium live events in Australia this year. And so I.
Craig
Really, it&rsquo;s coming to Australia, it&rsquo;s. Wrestling.
Marcus
Yeah, it&rsquo;s normally in Saudi Arabia, but it&rsquo;s gonna be in. WA this year.
Craig
Wow, what&rsquo;s stray?
Taylor
Is there? There was already one in WA at some point.
Marcus
Wasn&rsquo;t there? That was elimination chamber last year.
Craig
Wow, OK, so this is happening in Australia. What&rsquo;s the hype for it? Are you excited? Are.
Taylor
Chamber, yeah.
Craig
You got your tickets, are you?
Marcus
Tickets are like 5000 bucks. Man, I&rsquo;m.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
Not going and it&rsquo;s just five audience for this.
Speaker
Easy.
Craig
It&rsquo;s not the legal or it&rsquo;s the rich local.
Marcus
Wrestling at the moment is it&rsquo;s in its third major boom period. Third major global boom period after the after the rock and wrestling era in the 80s and the Attitude era in the late late 90s, early 2000s. And there are a lot of people who were huge fans in Australia and there would be a market to fill up a a 100,000 person stadium there, not before they did it for. Nation chamber because it&rsquo;s what, 22?
Craig
Million people, certainly a market, but it&rsquo;s.
Marcus
Expensive. Ohh, it&rsquo;s. And that&rsquo;s the reason why they one of the reasons why they post that every every single show they do is they&rsquo;re most profitable ever because they just Jack up the prices to diculous levels. They are so expensive it&rsquo;s $500 to sit in the gods. I&rsquo;m not sitting at the back of the stadium for 500 bucks.
Craig
Why is it so? Really. Yeah. Managed meeting.
Marcus
And travelling to Westminster, no. No, no, no. Wow.
Taylor
But they but they had the really big stars coming to Australia as well for that one, it wasn&rsquo;t just. Like randoms or like the lowest ones, it was the highest ones as well. That&rsquo;s why the price.
Marcus
Is so big. Yeah. And scene is gonna be at the WA one as. Well.
Taylor
Yeah.
Marcus
He&rsquo;s gonna be at crown.
Craig
Right, I said.
Marcus
Jewel. OK.
Craig
Sorry guys, it&rsquo;s going to be huge events. It&rsquo;s going to be enormous, but it&rsquo;s unlikely to be something that apart from if you enter a competition. You&rsquo;ll be able to.
Marcus
Get into it all depends about how and how much you&rsquo;re doing, I suppose. Yeah. I mean, I.
Craig
Space.
Marcus
I could afford it though. I just.
Craig
Is this? I mean is it gonna have a stream flavour to it? Are we gonna have? Rio Ripley appearing and recruiting for we&rsquo;re gonna have a little legal talent.
Marcus
Well, she was the main event at the last one that they had cause normally at the elimination chamber, because that&rsquo;s a six person match. Normally the men&rsquo;s elimination chamber would be the main event, the one that goes on last. But no, when when it was in WA last it was her defending her title and she was she went on last so I reckon she&rsquo;ll get the title.
Speaker
Yeah.
Marcus
Back at. At Crown Jewel in WA, because if she gets the title back in her home country, the pop is going to be enormous, people are going to go wild.
Craig
She&rsquo;s 8. Well, well, the Australian tourism body be kind of jumping on this and attempting to promote crocodiles or something. Or like like.
Taylor
So do you mean like bluey and hammer?
Craig
Bar. Yeah. And someone in a bluey costume. I wonder what those soft power optics will be.
Taylor
This is going to be some sort of.
Craig
For and like you know you got Formula One, you got various global sporting events that come to Australia. Australia works hard to secure and then sometimes states compete with each other to get those rights like Formula One was in Adelaide. And then no one wanted.
Taylor
If we had a stadium, they could do. It here. That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m.
Craig
Thinking should we speak?
Marcus
Ma&rsquo;am.
Craig
Local PM about that stadium and wrestling.
Marcus
I gotta say it&rsquo;s sad that Jake the snake Roberts is with AW because, like, think of all the all the Australian snakes you could handle if.
Speaker
Oh.
Marcus
He was your WA.
Craig
OK. So the other thing when I was doing homework for the episode was I came across some discussion of some of the things that didn&rsquo;t go according to plan at at the show. Oh no. I know there was some disappointment. That the what is it? The cable ties didn&rsquo;t work on one of the.
Marcus
Events. Yeah, there was a sequence in the Lyra of Alqueria versus Becky Lynch match, where Lynch pulls out a toolbox because it&rsquo;s notice qualification pulls out zip. Ties cable ties Larry Valkyries hands together. They&rsquo;re obviously very loosely tied, but you know it&rsquo;s you. Understand what I&rsquo;ve done it. And there&rsquo;s a bit where her hands just come out of the cable ties and she just freaks out and puts them back in.
Speaker
Hmm.
Craig
And what would you I mean? To keep the K. 5 Going you want to try to do it off camera? Yeah. But she was on.
Marcus
Camera, right. She&rsquo;s Laura. Valkyria is quite is. She&rsquo;s it. It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s only her first year on the main roster, so she&rsquo;s not used to.
Craig
Right.
Marcus
Revising was what she should have done. She should have just gotten out of them and, you know, called Becky over and they could redo the sport or something along those lines. But basically.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
She didn&rsquo;t wanna not follow the script. Yeah. And is that also the kind of anxiety in the fandom around that do is that kind of like, wow, you know, this is the problem with with wrestling. Now it&rsquo;s all on script or something. Is there a debate? Around what that reflects.
Marcus
Absolutely. That&rsquo;s 100% a complaint that a lot of modern, a lot of older fans have that have with that in the modern era.
Craig
30 years ago this, or 40 years ago, this would be.
Speaker
Yeah.
Marcus
It used to be you&rsquo;d write out a couple of like major story beats and then you&rsquo;d just improvise everything in the ring. One of the really famous examples of that happening is Summer Slam 1992, the Intercontinental Championship between Bret Hart and Davey Boy Smith, his brother in law, Davey Boy Smith had just come off all week long crack binge and he was on a massive crack cocaine downer and he pulls Bret Hart over in front of 92,000. People and he goes. Brett, I&rsquo;m fooked. I can&rsquo;t remember the March and Brett Hart goes. Don&rsquo;t worry about it. DV. I&rsquo;ll carry you. Just follow my lead. Hey. And so Brett Hart literally. Has to. There are so many that match is like at like a 9 1/2 out of 10 near perfect match considered the greatest Summer Slam match of all time. But there are so many rest holds because Brett Hart has to keep reminding Davey Boy Smith what he has to do next. And then Davey Boy wins at the end so hard.
Craig
Right.
Marcus
Carried that man and.
Craig
Yeah. Yeah. So any other surprise moments or things in the summer slam?
Marcus
There was 1 moment. So there&rsquo;s a wrestler carrying cross and his wife Scarlett Bordeaux. Both of them have been on the roster for a while. They haven&rsquo;t really had too many matches recently cause Carrie&rsquo;s basically The thing is, he&rsquo;s the corrupter. Right. His thing is he shows up and he&rsquo;s he&rsquo;ll try to corrupt a baby face and he will have his hair done in their hairstyle. That&rsquo;s his thing. And it&rsquo;s been knowledge all year that his contract is coming to an end and he&rsquo;s good mates with a lot of people on the roster. And so they tried to give him a really big push and give him some major matches on PL E and the fans have responded to this quite nicely and they were actually throughout the his math throughout other matches changing we want. Cross we want cross and in the post show. True, Triple H said. Did you hear those saying we want Brock? We want Brock and carrying cross and skull board. Those contracts expired earlier this week and they&rsquo;re not being rehired. They&rsquo;re now in the alumni section on the website. And so Triple H is actually no last week rather so trips is trying to basically convert the narrative of the audience calling out for carrying. Just to get rehired and say, oh, it&rsquo;s about Brock Lesnar. And so that was.
Craig
Not quite. All right, hold on the stream. &lsquo;S going weird.
Taylor
It is I&rsquo;m. I&rsquo;m just trying to. I&rsquo;m just trying to figure out if it&rsquo;s behind or. Anything that&rsquo;s cool.
Speaker
What?
Marcus
Ohh I&rsquo;ll tell you. I&rsquo;ll tell you a surprise that I had the Becky versus Valkyria match that we talked about just before the the intercontinent the the, the women&rsquo;s intercontinental about where the you know the the the zip tie is not working. Yes, I thought because that was their third match and I thought for certain that Laura Valkyrie was going to win that cause she was the hero with the feud. Ohh. Green screen.
Craig
I&rsquo;ll put my laptop camera.
Marcus
As I thought the entire few because she was the inaugural champion, they they had a. Match. She beats Becky. They have a rematch. Becky beats hers. So this is the third match after a triple threat match at evolution, which had Bailey in it as well. Who&rsquo;s the 3rd member of this story? Essentially. And I thought for certain liars gotta win. Baby face comes out on top now because she&rsquo;s very new. But he&rsquo;s been around for a very long time. Surely she&rsquo;ll come out on top. She&rsquo;ll be a made woman. And then Becky Lynch won IW. What that I did not expect. So we have we have our we have our bad guy wins ending and Becky is going to continue to terrorise the rest of the women&rsquo;s division. I thought I did not.
Craig
Expect that at all. So in terms of what&rsquo;s happening next in WB, what&rsquo;s the next big thing that we should start getting ready for?
Marcus
Clash in Paris, 31st of August.
Craig
Oh, that&rsquo;s in.
Marcus
Paris, yes. Which is really the 1st of September for us. So the confirmed matches thus far are John Cena versus Logan Paul.
Craig
Really, Logan? Paul. Logan. Paul.
Taylor
Wow, nice.
Craig
I mean, he&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s fit, right. He&rsquo;s not there as a joke.
Taylor
He said, yeah, he&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s pretty good at it.
Marcus
The man is a. The man is a superb performer. He&rsquo;s. Great athlete.
Craig
Yeah. And he is, of course, going to play a hero or he is a hero. He&rsquo;s the bad guy.
Marcus
He doesn&rsquo;t. Yeah. Yeah, he doesn&rsquo;t play a heel. He is heel.
Taylor
Yeah.
Marcus
So they they&rsquo;ve thrown it.
Craig
Well, that&rsquo;s a big that&rsquo;s. You know, reflects on how Big Luke and Paul is. I guess that he&rsquo;s given this match against Cena in his last year.
Speaker
OK.
Marcus
Yeah, it&rsquo;s like and it&rsquo;s because one of the criticisms about criticisms about seeing his retirement tour is that he&rsquo;s mostly fighting guys he fought 1015 years ago. Yeah. So the it&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s only had a couple of matches against the new talent and this is the most new talent he&rsquo;s had a match against because generally speaking, it&rsquo;s an unwritten rule for wrestlers that you lose your last match.
Craig
Really.
Marcus
Against younger talent to make them look.
Craig
Good. Who do you think that&rsquo;s gonna get set up?
Marcus
For this year, I could not tell you. All I know is that scene as last match is gonna be in Boston. It&rsquo;s gonna be a Saturday night main event, so it will be broadcast on NBC and YouTube. And I think if he loses in Boston, then there&rsquo;s. Going to be a riot.
Craig
Alright. Right. So they might have to not go to convention.
Marcus
Yeah, because there are. There are very few times where a wrestler will win their their final match. I mean there was the match that stone cold had against Kevin Owens a couple of years ago. It was Stone Cold&rsquo;s first match in 19 years and he won because it was in Texas. And if he had lost, there would have been a riot and. Someone would try to kill Kevin Owens. Sting won his retirement match, but that was mostly because he&rsquo;d spent 35 years getting messed around by terrible creative. Goldberg lost his retirement match in Atlanta to Gunther earlier in the year, and then it was a terrific match. Then he went online and criticised it because NBC cut off his retirement speech. Like, bro, it&rsquo;s on YouTube. Just go to the WWE channel. Just be grateful you gotta retire the match. Be grateful you gotta retire the match, unlike. Bret Hart, whose career you ended when you nearly kicked his head.
Craig
Right. It&rsquo;s.
Marcus
But sorry, straying from the point of the matches that are going to be there, that&rsquo;s going to be fatal four way for the World Heavyweight Championship, which is gonna, which is the main belt on raw, it&rsquo;s going to be between Seth Rollins, he&rsquo;s got the belt, CM Punk, LA Night and.
Craig
This is the big one. You&rsquo;re just setting. Up the storyline.
Marcus
And also Jay USO, who had the belt earlier in the year and everyone loves him because of his theme song and they&rsquo;re setting up Cody Rhodes versus Drew McIntyre. Drew McIntyre is one of the best performers they have is he is a monster heel in the ring. He basically he&rsquo;s a Scottish warlord, essentially.
Taylor
True.
Marcus
And he he&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s built like a brick house. He&rsquo;s got the evil beard, the menacing eyebrows. He just looks like a bad guy. But he&rsquo;s also, like, extremely funny. So he&rsquo;ll just like.
Speaker
But. It&rsquo;s true.
Taylor
Well, it&rsquo;s this.
Craig
Costume at the moment is it is it? Kind of mediaeval Scottish cute.
Marcus
Probably. Basically looks like the bad boy love interest in a mediaeval isekai young adult. Novel, yes, true.
Taylor
Sorry.
Marcus
Yeah. And he&rsquo;s just hilarious because he&rsquo;ll be the savage in the ring, and then he&rsquo;ll just say ridiculous things. In his problem is there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s the moment where senior and Cody bury the hatchet and make friends on smack down. He just comes out and goes. No, you hang up. No, you hang up and it&rsquo;s just. Come on, man. He just he&rsquo;s just got got a very dry wit. And also 70. Stephanie Baker versus Naomi for the women&rsquo;s world. Championship, which is the Royal Women&rsquo;s Belt. So those are the three four matches that we&rsquo;ve got so far. Yeah. Cody Rhodes versus Drew McIntyre isn&rsquo;t confirmed, but it&rsquo;s probable.
Craig
Right. And that&rsquo;s in Paris in Paris? Patty. Right. So again, it would be fun to are there any Paris performers at the moment?
Marcus
Any French performers?
Speaker
Yeah.
Craig
I&rsquo;m imagining someone in a mine costume dresses, right?
Taylor
Yeah.
Marcus
Look, most of the performers are. There are a few Irish performers, a few Aussies, a lot of Japanese and South American performers. But I don&rsquo;t think there are any from France at the moment. They have been in the past, but not right. Now.
Craig
Alright. Our final thoughts on wrapping up how summer slam and upcoming matches are going to evolve.
Taylor
In 40 seconds or less.
Craig
20 seconds or less so.
Marcus
I enjoyed summer slam, but there even better pay per views. It wasn&rsquo;t as good as evolution which. Was.
Craig
Incredible. All right, we have a message for you that you can answer.
Taylor
Yeah, yeah, it just is really off topic. But can I put can you put me as a reference on their resume? That&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re asking. And sure they can be put as a reference.
Speaker
Yeah.
Craig
Fantastic, helping helping the world out here on media.
Taylor
I&rsquo;ll do that.
Craig
I&rsquo;ve been your host, Craig, joined by co-host Taylor.
Taylor
Yep, there&rsquo;s 5 seconds. Come on, man.

Craig
Welcome here to Edge Radio 99.3 FM with Craig as your host joined as always by Taylor. What&rsquo;s up Co host and this is now media mothership on media mothership. We explore how. Media and popular culture changes and shapes our world around us. In particular, I think the last week&rsquo;s episode, which we did on Cyberpunk had a fantastic thumbnail image for its YouTube and podcast, not really reacting with genuine. After an emotion so.
Speaker
Yeah.
Craig
That&rsquo;s all real, of course, because we are streaming on YouTube and Twitch. If you wanna see a video of us sitting here talking, you can jump onto the YouTube and Twitch. Let us know if the video audio is working. Last week we ran without audio.
Taylor
No.
Craig
And then we still got a couple of views. So I don&rsquo;t know what that says about our audio. But do let us know if the audio isn&rsquo;t. Working audio is. Certainly, but how will they?
Speaker
Use.
Craig
Know well because they can then go to the FM signal if they&rsquo;re within the Hobart metropolitan area.
Taylor
OK. Yeah. But if they&rsquo;ve already logged into this, then they&rsquo;re like Ohh Craig&rsquo;s just balled it up again.
Craig
Yeah. Then they log into youedgeradio.org dot AU. Wow.
Taylor
But they might not do.
Craig
Fine. Yes, they won&rsquo;t.
Speaker 4
Hear this, which is a shame.
Taylor
Exactly.
Speaker 4
But they would already.
Craig
Be fans of media mothership knowing. Then we also go. Off on the live stream on. Medium mothership sorry edgeradio.org dot yes.
Speaker
You.
Craig
We&rsquo;re also on the DAB. So feel free to audience interact with us on our SMS 0488811707 or post a comment on the Twitch or YouTube live stream, yeah. Let&rsquo;s hit the songs. That&rsquo;s beautiful. Thank you so much. Should I put both of your mics on? I wonder? You got kind of a stereotype happening there. Yeah. OK, good. Right. So today&rsquo;s topic. We are going back in time to 1995.
Taylor
No, just this one.
Craig
Oh yes, I came across.
Taylor
The year of my birth.
Craig
I. Ohh great what auspicious state? That was the year I completed my honours thesis. Looking at the irresponsible images of cyberpunk in Japanese animation, and I came across recently as I was cleaning up my. You know, huge archive of a library. One of the magazines I used to do my research with.
Speaker 4
Well that.
Craig
Was this one? Yeah, we&rsquo;ll hold that up to the camera. So this is comics and interviews 1995, issue 148. And this is at the cusp of anime kind of entering the western market, so I&rsquo;ve been. Kind of uploading my honest thesis to the media mothership website. Wow. So you know, people are gonna get so excited by this episode. They can go and read the honest thesis that that, you know, was part of the background research. But we&rsquo;re going to spend this article looking at the first article. We&rsquo;re going to spend this show looking. At the first article. In that magazine, which is speculating on the future, the current 1995 business structure of manga and anime in the US, and what the near future holds.
Taylor
As it says, what is anime and why is everybody talking about?
Craig
Yeah, so here it is.
Taylor
No, if you don&rsquo;t know what anime is, you probably call it a.
Craig
9 or something like that. Well, *** animation was the term. There was awkwardly used. Yeah, up until this point. So this is 30 years ago, so it&rsquo;s 2/20/25 now, so it&rsquo;s an opportune moment to look back 30 years ago as to what was this. Kind of, you know, quite quite significant cultural change, which was about to hit, I guess, just to put context, you know, put people in context. A quick snapshot of what 1995 was about, right. You&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re looking in terms of what the Internet meant in 1995. You you only had dial-up, so it was that classic modem sound sound. Google didn&rsquo;t exist.
Taylor
No, no.
Craig
Of course, you know it was very limited. It was, you know, you&rsquo;ve got universities have it. Some homes have it, but not everyone was at all engaged with the Internet. Well, you had really, there weren&rsquo;t any smartphones in 95, right, or at least not in my in my space, 95 was not a a kind of. I mean they were. They were smart furs, but they were really expensive.
Taylor
Really.
Craig
It wasn&rsquo;t. It wasn&rsquo;t a really smartphone era.
Taylor
No, I&rsquo;m talking flip phone.
Craig
Yeah, I mean, I do remember I got a phone, I got a phone, an old phone in like, 96. But it was super very expensive. Here&rsquo;s the one. Yeah. I mean, you had to pay for SMS calls. Yeah, right. It was incredibly expensive.
Taylor
Click on that smile. Yeah, he he is. For me. Oh no, that was that was when I was alive. You. Had to pay for SMS calls or or.
Craig
Alright, still into your age? Yeah.
Taylor
Or dollar per minute, sort of.
Craig
Thing. Yeah, I mean, I mean mainly you, you just use landline still there wasn&rsquo;t social media, social media was not a thing. And in terms of entertainment, we&rsquo;re looking at, you know particularly access to anime. It was either. Bootleg stuff. So you go to your local anime club at a university or some mates. House and you just watched bootleg VHS tapes that were on these mail order catalogues you could grab, and they&rsquo;re all fan subtitled. And it was super niche, right? The the kind of anime access was was very narrow. There was, you know, previous that Astro Boy battle for the planet Kimber. The white line that had been on television. Many people didn&rsquo;t really flock to those as being a distinctive Japanese experience. In fact, many people didn&rsquo;t know they came from Japan.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
So of course, today we have a very different landscape. You know, you&rsquo;ve got streaming, you&rsquo;ve got Crunchyroll streaming all the anime. You&rsquo;ve got cons which are set up specifically on anime cosplayers. So it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a radically different environment. You know, back then you were basically looking at TV schedules to figure out if SBS was going to show an anime movie.
Speaker
Hmm.
Craig
This wouldn&rsquo;t be 95. I mean SBS started to broadcast. And they, you know, I think probably late 90s anyway. So it was a much more niche space. It wasn&rsquo;t on demand and binge watching as it is today. So it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a radically radically different environment. Which is why the environment was kind of filled with images like this. We&rsquo;ll we&rsquo;ll play a short clip from Manga Entertainment. This was their cyberpunk, cyberpunk, cyberpunk cyberpunk collection promotion, right, tying into last week&rsquo;s discussion of Cyberpunk 2077.
Taylor
Flunk.
Craig
This is their pitch. This was 1995, so this is the turntable came out. This is the Cyberpunk collection promotion which gives you a taste of how anime was being marketed as a type of subversive, risky, futuristic experience that wasn&rsquo;t at all. The cartoons you&rsquo;re watching.
Taylor
At home, yeah.
Craig
All right.
Taylor
Nice.
Speaker 4
Yeah, any moment now.
Taylor
Do do, do, do do. Just talk amongst. Yourselves. Ohh, here we go. Here we go. Here we go. That we&rsquo;re still not going. You can&rsquo;t help digging.
Craig
Yeah. No, it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s yeah. Chest is loading up.
Speaker 5
As a team, sooner than you imagine. Presents you with the. A hyper reality experience that will reload your mind. 3 Series 9 episodes hard data, unlimited information, easy Access the Cyberpunk collection. Get. Ready for them? Cyber City Oedo 808 data one to three hard hitting criminals turn cops come up against some real mean cases in a bid to reduce their sentences. It can only mean action all the way to suicides. 80 police one to three, the police force of the future has its hands full, keeping crazy sideboards on control, especially when they look this cute. Don&rsquo;t.
Speaker 6
Watch it and squeamish.
Speaker
You can give me what Alice used to. Get me do that.
Speaker 5
Genocide in three mind-blowing hearts when a nutty professor plays with powers beyond his control, you can always be sure something&rsquo;s gonna happen. Well, it doesn&rsquo;t happen any weirder than this unbelievable entertainment. The Cyberpunk collection downloaded on video the future now.
Craig
Alright, so that&rsquo;s manga entertainments. Pitch for, you know, download the future on VHS.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
Now, so you know, it&rsquo;s throwing in this kind of assortment of future terms like download.
Taylor
Yeah, but.
Craig
Very much based in this kind of mid 90s non Internet based experience of you know you.
Speaker 4
Download it to your VHS, yeah.
Speaker
Which is.
Craig
So what I want to do now is with that in mind, right? So that&rsquo;s this idea of, you know mid 90s introducing manga and anime. Let&rsquo;s I&rsquo;ve I&rsquo;ve converted the article to audio using Clipchamp and an AI voice. So yeah, full acknowledgement that I. Just did it to me really.
Taylor
Did did you type it in or did you use sort of like AI vision to make the words?
Craig
Great. I scanned it and then I did OCR and I mean I could.
Taylor
OK. Scammed. Yeah.
Craig
Get you to read it, but. No, let&rsquo;s not. Yeah. So.
Taylor
I prefer to hear the.
Speaker 4
What?
Taylor
Voice of well hear.
Craig
How disastrous the AI is, and then we might change our mind. So here it is. So this is what we&rsquo;ll do is we&rsquo;ll go through like I do in my tutorials, paragraph by paragraph, breaking it down and analysing what it gets right, what it gets wrong about what it&rsquo;s foreseeing in the future. What shed some insight into? You. What media consumption was like back then and kind of, you know what, it underestimates all these?
Taylor
Questions. So who? Who&rsquo;s speaking?
Craig
Now this is so this article, it&rsquo;s weird. This article isn&rsquo;t attributed to an author right, but I was reading through it and I reckon this is a kind of promotion piece for one of the main US anime distributors at the time.
Taylor
Hmm.
Craig
They&rsquo;re called video comics coming out of. I think it&rsquo;s streamlined entertainment back then, most of the companies it&rsquo;s referring to have been brought up or become something else some.
Taylor
Yeah, I&rsquo;m. I I I meant the AI voice.
Craig
Of them, yeah. It&rsquo;s not Davis. It&rsquo;s not Davis. It&rsquo;s not Davis. They&rsquo;ve updated their AI voices so sadly not Davis, but yeah, this is an unattributed article via.
Taylor
Well, it says it says on the front. David Anthony Crafts Comics interview, so maybe it&rsquo;s David.
Craig
No, that&rsquo;s the editor of the magazine. And there is an editorial in that is an editorial in there but not there. Alright, let&rsquo;s start with paragraph 11 is anime and why is everybody talking about it from 1995 comics interviews issue 148.
Taylor
Then maybe he wrote. Too.
Speaker
All right. Do that.
Speaker 8
Why is everybody talking about it? Issue 140, eight, 1995? Over the past few years? Animation produced for the Japanese domestic. Market, known as anime, has been finding its way onto shelves in comic books, specialty retail shops, and video stores throughout the country. It is a business which has evolved out of an underground, unlicensed movement to bring this material into the states by the vanity duplication, red bootlegging of imported anime laser discs. The material which has surfaced. Has remained for the most part, niche product, which augments the imported manga Japanese comics. An occasional imported video game, which makes its way West. The potential for mainstream exposure to anime will be put to the test by several factors, including the syndicated television release of Sailor Moon and Dragon Ball, as well as upcoming video releases by mainstream distribution entities such as Sony Polygram and Orion Pictures. There are rumours that Marvel may even be considering. Entering into this field, Sony is launching its effort in.
Speaker 4
Alright, I will.
Craig
The and I&rsquo;ll pause it. There. So that&rsquo;s OK. So that&rsquo;s. This was first two paragraphs of I mean anything there that that rings a bell of familiarity to you. You were born on 95. So this isn&rsquo;t part of your lived experience. No. This was the world you were born into that it&rsquo;s prophesizing that, umm, you know we&rsquo;ve got Sailor Moon and Dragonball around the corner which is going to possibly be the. I mean this is the US market. So the strain market is slightly different, but I think you know certainly in terms of explaining the contemporary environment, it&rsquo;s much more globalised today. So we&rsquo;ve got Sailor Moon and Dragon Ball. We&rsquo;ve got companies like Sony, Polygram, Orion Pictures and Marvel. Anything leap off the page to you and say, Oh yes, I know.
Taylor
That well, the thing that immediately leaps off the page when it was read out to me was. Anime laser discs.
Craig
That is old fashion, isn&rsquo;t it? Laser disc have. You ever used watched laser?
Taylor
No, I don&rsquo;t know. What it is?
Craig
Ohh right lazy. This is a fantastic they came out kind of the next quantum leap up from VHS tapes. Yeah, it&rsquo;s meant to offer a more crisper digital image the size you could get them in will record sizes. So there were huge the size of an LP record.
Speaker
Hmm.
Taylor
Right. OK.
Craig
And you would normally need to get like 2 discs, 2 play an entire movie out. Of. They were quite clunky. They were prone to scratch and.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
They they only had a tiny market in Australia. I know when I went to when I was living in Sydney, I often go to the Chinatown video stores and they&rsquo;d have laser discs. You could get of Hong Kong Action Cinema. So I&rsquo;d often pick up a laser disc from them. And because I was in student accommodation with some Hong Kong students, they&rsquo;d have laser discs they&rsquo;d.
Speaker
Hmm.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
Brought home or brought back from Hong Kong, so it wasn&rsquo;t really an Australian market. But yeah, look, I mean this and also the US market, at least the discs. So it&rsquo;s not really a UK, Australian experience industry.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
Yeah. So that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s wonderfully dated. Yeah, the, the, the laser disc anime, laser disc space. The great thing about those laser discs were was that they they did get the you got the full art covers. So just like people love records for their arts because they&rsquo;re so large and the. The art can really pop seam with the laser discs, right compared to a a little crummy VHS box. The laser disc presentation was was was gorgeous, yeah, but super expensive.
Taylor
So this is Marvel is that that&rsquo;s not what&rsquo;s it called Marvel, that&rsquo;s not US.
Craig
That was that was you just Marvel. There was Marvel Comics, right? So this is, you know, I mean, Marvel went through a number of hiccups but was still considered one of the big media players in terms of, you know, certainly. I mean it was, it was this with DC superhero comic producer.
Taylor
Novels. OK.
Craig
Marvel hadn&rsquo;t done much in terms of animation. A couple of projects, but it wasn&rsquo;t successful. But nevertheless, yeah. It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s Marvel&rsquo;s interest in manga was seen as one of these moments of wow, a big US comic book publisher is considering entering the comic book space. Yeah, none of that of course happened. I mean, it&rsquo;s a bit right and wrong. I mean, Sailor Moon, you&rsquo;re familiar with Sailor Moon? Did you ever experience anything to do with?
Taylor
Never, never watched any of it, but of it. And I&rsquo;ve seen pictures.
Craig
Of it, right? So it completely missed.
Taylor
You yeah.
Craig
Yeah, I mean it. Was on Australian TV for a bit. And you know in 95 it launched in Canada as a syndicated cartoon show and then to the US at the end of 95 and it made it its way to the UK and Australia and was part of the the kind of morning, the school morning and afternoon cartoon blocks.
Speaker
Hmm.
Taylor
I mean, it might have been when I was, like, conscious, but yeah, pretty pretty much my thing was between 2004 and 2012 is what I remember since for being.
Craig
Look it. Yeah, yeah. And look, Salamine didn&rsquo;t become.
Taylor
A child.
Craig
The big success? That was prophesised in terms of it was successful, but it wasn&rsquo;t a huge cultural phenomena that again, you know they they point to Dragon Ball as the next.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
Possible cab off the rank that&rsquo;s going to create a huge swell and mainstream manga and enemy interest that is a little stronger. Dragon Ball Z gained quite a larger following and again launched in 95. It did struggle initially with low ratings.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
But has still ticked over what&rsquo;s considered a mediocre success. Yes, it&rsquo;s interesting as I&rsquo;m reading through this article that the the big success isn&rsquo;t mentioned. Which is Pokemon. Oh, yeah, yeah, right. So Pokemon didn&rsquo;t come on the scene until 98 in terms of its animation run, and you can really see there what? What? What? It took to become successful, right? That yes, while Dragon Ball and salmon are are mainstream successful properties, they weren&rsquo;t at the level of Pok&eacute;mon and it&rsquo;s kind of huge machine of success across video games. Plushies, cartoons and you know, the fact that pretty much everyone&rsquo;s heard of Pok&eacute;mon.
Taylor
Hmm.
Craig
You know, in a way beyond, you know, I&rsquo;ve seen an image. Of Sailor Moon. Yeah. Experience. So the real success that they&rsquo;re hoping for doesn&rsquo;t come until at least after 98, you know, in the US you have those kind of syndicated or those kind of compilation cartoon shows for kids called. Tsunami, which was much like cartoon connection or Agro&rsquo;s cartoon show or.
Taylor
All of these, which I&rsquo;ve never.
Craig
Within. Yeah, I mean it&rsquo;s state by state, right, in Australia, I&rsquo;m not sure what test he had in terms of like some shows after you come home from school, there&rsquo;d be a host that would introduce cartoons.
Taylor
Heard of? Yeah. Watch roller coaster.
Speaker 4
That you&rsquo;d.
Craig
OK, roller coaster here, except it&rsquo;s that you know I had. Yeah. Ohh, yeah. TV, right. Yeah. So those would. Those are the moments in the strain market, those curated experiences, that would then hype and introduce animation.
Taylor
Chase TV.
Craig
Those which made that successful change, but that wasn&rsquo;t, yeah, that wasn&rsquo;t this 95 period, nor the initial years after 95. It really didn&rsquo;t reach into that success. And certainly in terms of Sailor Moon and Dragonball Z, you know both. Both were were middling successes. They&rsquo;re fondly remembered, but it wasn&rsquo;t in terms of how the articles kind of setting up the the the big hope for success.
Taylor
They&rsquo;re still relatively well known.
Craig
Yeah, yeah, yeah. So a small I mean a small clip in terms of you know, so this is what this is a short another short example from another Saturday anime promo from 95. This is from the US channel. I think it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s the Sci fi channel in 1995, so this gives you an example of what the promotion was for anime in 1995 in America for their site site.
Taylor
On the Sci Fi channel, yeah.
Speaker 6
This fall, Saturday mornings on the Sci Fi channel, it&rsquo;s Japanese animation in the raw and this ain&rsquo;t no swim in the. People being urge anime that&rsquo;s pure power and sheer genius. Saturday anime on the Sci Fi Channel coming this fall.
Speaker 7
See ready to receive this sacrifice?
Craig
So it&rsquo;s a little more salacious. Yeah, you know, it&rsquo;s.
Speaker
Hey.
Craig
Very much that kind of coming in.
Taylor
Animated television doesn&rsquo;t have to be for kids anymore.
Speaker
Yeah.
Speaker 4
That&rsquo;s it, yeah.
Craig
Yeah. And I guess that&rsquo;s the market they&rsquo;re trying to open up. Yeah, it&rsquo;s not just the children&rsquo;s experience anymore. It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s adult and risky. Anyway, jumping back to.
Speaker
The article? Yep.
Speaker 8
Animated version of Street Fighter Two offered at an extreme selfie price point, Polygram has taken on the distribution of the US branch of a UK company, manga Entertainment and Orion. Home video has entered the picture by making an output deal with streamlined pictures to serve as the distribution arm of streamlined video comics library. Each of these distribution companies has a different approach in attempting to bring this material to the mass.
Speaker 4
Sorry.
Speaker 8
Market Sony and Polygram are handling the video distribution as a traditional music company distributor. Orion, on the other hand, has concentrated on distributing streamlined video comics as a traditional video distributor.
Craig
There. So it&rsquo;s interesting. The reference to manga and attainment so. Manga. I mean the the Australian experience of manga and anime was really heavily defined through the success the US. Manga anime import companies had, like in particular, Manga Entertainment, and they took a much more direct to video market. You could pick those up at your video store and so forth, whereas in the US, yeah, they&rsquo;re setting up this idea of. You know, later on we&rsquo;ll talk about trying to do a they&rsquo;ll do a these are release first. They&rsquo;ll bring it to an arts cinema. Mm-hmm. And then they&rsquo;ll get mail, order, catalogue sales going so not as successful as my entertainments began became Sony. You know what they&rsquo;re talking about, you know, Sony Polygram.
Speaker 7
Yeah.
Craig
The. And and video comic, Sony is really the only one today.
Taylor
That, yeah, it&rsquo;s still around.
Craig
That&rsquo;s, you know, yeah, that that&rsquo;s the long term winner of the, you know, setting up the manga anime experience that they&rsquo;ve got and not at all the way I mean here they&rsquo;re characterising Sony as you know a traditional music company distributor whereas yeah the Sony.
Speaker
Hmm.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
They you know where they their own Spiderman and it owns, you know it. It sets up its own animation division. So it&rsquo;s a much larger.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
Content creator today than it was in 95 and very much this kind of the 95 Sony they&rsquo;re talking about. Isn&rsquo;t what?
Taylor
It became. I can&rsquo;t believe you just called Sony a content creator.
Craig
Yeah, there. Yeah, Sony, Sony did some anime content creation content creator. Yeah. Like, like, Mr Beast. Yeah. Yeah. Sonny&rsquo;s content creator. Mr Beast, content creator. Yeah. So the. This. Yeah, the Orion home videos set up with streamlined pictures trying to grow that American popular culture anime space. But it was very short lived. I mean, I mean, there was a boom here in 95. UM, but yeah, the the irony being that. The prediction that they&rsquo;re making here is right and wrong. Orion&rsquo;s traditional video distribution approach. Did work quite well initially, but then it was Sonny&rsquo;s pivot to actually making that content rather than just distributing it. That that made the huge difference. Let&rsquo;s see how.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
The article goes on to explain Orion and some of the products that Orion was working.
Speaker 8
On Ryan, approach seems to work given the context of streamlined library. Since its inception seven years ago. Streamline Pictures has concentrated on acquiring. The best theatrical anime available for distribution in North America streamlines initial exploitation of these films begins with theatrical exhibition in independent theatres and through theatrical repertory. Once an animated film has received some critical reception and played through a number of major city.
Taylor
I mean fantastic.
Speaker 8
It is made available for home video, streamlined string of theatrical releases include Akira, Fist of the North Star, the professional Vampire Hunter Dee Robot, Carnival Lensman, Wicked City, and the forthcoming space adventure Cobra.
Craig
So North star, the. The professional vampire hunter D Akira robot Carnival Linsman wicked city space adventure cobra. You know, these were really the big titles that got global interest in the West from Japan.
Taylor
And have now become unknown.
Craig
I guess yeah, the the very nostalgically remembered Akira, Fist of the North Star.
Taylor
Spiderman Batman lend man with the magnifying glass.
Craig
You know, you say they they are pretty dated. Well, I guess. OK, I&rsquo;ll play a clip. So here&rsquo;s some promotion. Here&rsquo;s some promotions for those. Particular title, so this is the Akira Sci Fi channel promotion. We&rsquo;ll have a little listen to that just to put us in the mood as to how they&rsquo;re promoting it. It was it was a good strategy they had in terms of first. Releasing them on cinema in the cinema and in our kind of art house cinemas. So Akira 98. Sorry in 1988 was distributed Tantric ally in the US. Many of these other titles came to Australia in anime kind of movie festivals that would play at, you know, village or Hoyts for a short period of time. Yeah, they were.
Speaker 6
Yeah.
Taylor
Other cinemas also available.
Craig
Well, I mean that was the thing about these strange cinema market. There were small boutique cinemas, but you were pretty much talking about cause. I know I went to see the anime festival. The manga, manga, manga. Festival that had fist of the North Star Gogo 13 robot Carnival space adventure cobra and that was that was that. That was at Hoyts, right? Yeah. You were still stuck going to your your big cinema. And that was the Australian market, the. The smaller cinema chains were, yeah, but weren&rsquo;t located as centrally. Anyway, here&rsquo;s the Akira promo from 98.
Speaker 7
Warning the following offer is for mature audiences only. Exciting, mysterious, intense, graphic, provocative, raw. This is no ordinary animation. This is the exotic, bizarre and beautiful world of Japanese anime and this is your invitation to enter with a modern. Classic Akira. Critics say Akira makes Blade Runner look like Disney World. It&rsquo;s action packed, the future of animation. Siskel and Ebert call it the video pick of the week. Akira is yours for only four. 35 with subscription when you order the best of Japanese animation collection series with these state of the art sci-fi classics, you will enter a world beyond imagination. A future out of control and an experience you will never forget. Don&rsquo;t say we didn&rsquo;t warn you. Call 1-800-414-4422 now. To order Akira for only 495 plus.
Craig
3495.
Speaker 7
79.
Taylor
Yeah.
Speaker 6
Volumes are 19.
Speaker 4
That&rsquo;s the cheap. Anyway, that phone number probably doesn&rsquo;t work anymore. You could ask for your phone 95 copy of it here. But yeah it.
Craig
Was it was a really interesting strategy in terms of this idea of prestige anime they were offering with titles like Akira. It was going to be this kind of approaching 21st century anime portal that you could watch at the cinema and then you&rsquo;d order it via mail. The catalogue? Yeah, to get it. And that was the US model where it wasn&rsquo;t the Australian and UK model was different. It was really manga. Entertainment did a fantastic job of getting into all the video stores, getting their product pushed out, you know, five titles for 10 bucks or how much it was. Whereas yes, the US markets here was theatrical release then order it online, you know, and the VHS&rsquo;s were were, I don&rsquo;t know VHS&rsquo;s were really expensive to produce and distribute. So 495 and 98, you must have been stuck in a kind of like this is your first one.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
And then you&rsquo;ve gotta get 10 other titles at $40 each or something.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
Uh, also, what&rsquo;s interesting here is that this strategy. Of course exists without without a kind of Internet fan community that we have today, where they&rsquo;d be bingeing or where you just get through the whole episode you were waiting for whenever this movie was gonna get scheduled, then you&rsquo;d watch the video. There&rsquo;d be a trailer like that at the start. So it was, I guess, what this is emphasising is it&rsquo;s niche.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a small amount of product. You have to timetable yourself to get to the movie, to watch it, then you have to. Order it umm, wait for it to come in the mail or go to the video store and whatever titles they&rsquo;ve stocked is what you&rsquo;re going to to watch and I guess you&rsquo;ve got, you know, word of mouth that this is trying to build. So let&rsquo;s go to the next paragraph.
Speaker 8
Has been the company&rsquo;s focus on distributing English language versions of these films. The bulk of the material released in the US has been put out in subtitled versions, streamlines President Karl Massack, an animation producer in his own right, has noted that all animation is dubbed, and that streamlines goal is to make viewer friendly product, which will be. Easy to assimilate by the mainstream public. The longevity of these titles as classic anime and the quality of the original and English language post production have positioned streamlines Video comics titles as an Evergreen Library, which sells significant numbers for every title month after month. A recent article in Newsweek still points to Akira as the major title in this niche genre.
Craig
All animation is dubbed which is which is a little inside to one of the big debates that raged back then in 95 and still today, which is the sub versus dub debates, right, which this article is staking its claim with. Carl Macek&rsquo;s claim that.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
You know or point that all the animation is dubbed to legitimise the English dubbing of anime. That was pretty much the standard during this 95 period. Most of the titles.
Speaker
Hmm.
Craig
You were going to be watching dubbed, and there was some backlash amongst some fans at that point saying they&rsquo;d prefer it subbed. Yeah. But that was considered a a premium product that you had to pay more for to get the subtitled version. And you know, there weren&rsquo;t as many titles available. Most of the titles were going to be dubbed. And the idea being what there was that, you know, it needed to be, as the article saying viewer friendly product which is easy to assume. Relate by the mainstream public, and their idea was that the only way that could happen would be is is dubbing it into English. What do you have any feelings about the dub versus sub debate? Do you reckon they were right there that actually you know it it it did require it to get dumped that it was when it was dubbed in English that it was.
Speaker
But.
Taylor
All I can talk about is is, from what I&rsquo;ve seen, I prefer dark. Pok&eacute;mon, Pok&eacute;mon. Yeah. Spirited away all of Studio Ghibli.
Craig
Any reason why? Why do you prefer dumb?
Taylor
I don&rsquo;t know. It just sounds better to my ears, yeah.
Speaker 8
Oh, it does.
Craig
I mean there there&rsquo;s a whole series. If you&rsquo;re bored looking for something to do. Do a YouTube search of Subverse dub. There all these compilations of which performance does it better?
Speaker 9
Yeah.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
I mean the initial 95 period is notorious for having poorly paid. Unprofessional. Yeah, you know, non voice actor people doing the dub.
Taylor
Yeah.
Speaker
Hmm.
Taylor
Have you ever you&rsquo;ve seen squid game? Yes. Have you listened to the dubbed versions Squid game? It is.
Craig
Oh, heaven, yeah, I can&rsquo;t. Well, I it&rsquo;s not. I can&rsquo;t. I could, but.
Taylor
It is. It is really terrible.
Craig
Makes it so bad.
Taylor
Because they the the the voice actors for I had no idea. They don&rsquo;t put any emphasis or any. Like change to their voice and they said Ohh that person has died. Now let me go over here.
Craig
And yeah, look and and you know, in some ways that&rsquo;s where this philosophy could be considered as as short sighted in terms of in today&rsquo;s streaming environment where you can choose double sub at the flick of a switch. It does give you this experience of listening to the actor themselves perform possibly a more authentic experience than the unemotional dub that it.
Taylor
Sounds like whereas if you have Howl&rsquo;s moving castle, yeah, Hal played by Christian Bale in his best performance.
Craig
Really. OK. Yeah, yeah. Because I know well, I think Ponyo has Liam Nielsen in it. There was a moment where Jubilee. I mean, see, that&rsquo;s the other thing. That this article, this. Jubilee was after this article as well, so this is the other. I mean, I point to two things that happened after this article, which really did make anime huge.
Taylor
Yes. Yeah.
Speaker
Hmm.
Craig
And neither of which are in this article because. It would be a problem. One is Pok&eacute;mon and the second one is Jubilee, right that that Jubilee was. I mean, this article was talking a lot about aspiring to mainstream success that were looking for his titles and dubbing it so we can get it into family-friendly product that can be easily assimilated to the mainstream public. That arrived with. With Jubilee, yeah, right. And and anything up until Jubilee was a partial success. Right, Sailor Moon. Right. All these efforts to launch. I mean, none of the titles. So. Far that we&rsquo;ve looked at. You know, Akira, Fist of the North Star Gogo 13, the professional vampire hunter. Do you? Robot Carnival lensman, wicked city space adventurer are family friendly, right? They&rsquo;re all very much your niche Sci Fi action adventure violence, you know. Whereas yes, it wasn&rsquo;t until jubbly.
Taylor
Yeah. Violent.
Craig
I feel like you know my neighbour Totoro spirit was spirited away was the film that synchronised both? I think the same time it launched in Japan, it launched in the West and was considered to be enormously globally successful.
Taylor
Yeah.
Speaker
For.
Craig
And then the the dubbing for it. Also you&rsquo;d have famous Western actors starting to dub jiggly films in particular. So yeah, yeah. And that, that, that that&rsquo;s not until quite a few years after this this article. But it is I mean the one thing.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
They get right is the. Is that kind of prestige anime, which is what Jubilee also offered? Yeah, that Jubilee offered that prestige product. Which is family friendly, that once it&rsquo;s dubbed, it&rsquo;s it doesn&rsquo;t lose its japaneseness, which I think is where this article gets it wrong as well. I think they define, you know, viewer friendly product that is easy to assimilate by the mainstream public. Also you know not to Japanese, right? Yes, it can be cyberpunk future.
Taylor
Hmm.
Craig
It can be, you know, assassin James Bond type character and Gogo 13 BS. Not that and and I guess the other title here that I mean 95 Evangelion screens in Japan, it&rsquo;s not until a few years later that it screens in Australia in the West. So Evangelion also probably is that the title it&rsquo;s still a bit niche though, isn&rsquo;t it? Evangelion not really.
Taylor
I&rsquo;ve not heard of him.
Craig
You have really. Yeah. You and Gina Cecil. Evangelion. Ohh yeah. Well, see, that&rsquo;s interesting. So that was a real cultural touchstone. Anime. It was on TV. People fell in love with it. But maybe a bit like attack on Titan, right? If.
Speaker 4
You.
Taylor
I&rsquo;ve I&rsquo;ve heard.
Speaker 10
Yeah.
Craig
Of one piece right. You have to be of that generation. To to to say ohh that that broke through to the mainstream. Yeah. Yeah. OK. Yeah. OK. That&rsquo;s interesting. Yeah. So in that case, that&rsquo;s not the third factor. It&rsquo;s still Pok&eacute;mon and Ghibli films. Yeah, that are really the two central properties. Alright. Well, let&rsquo;s push on. Let&rsquo;s push on.
Speaker 8
Recent activity in the acquisition of Anime Properties by a growing number of US distributors has given streamline and Orion cores to reevaluate their marketing strategy. But rather than compete with the glut of product, it&rsquo;s flooding the.
Craig
Market I don&rsquo;t.
Speaker 8
Know what that streamline is? Content to work on quality productions. It&rsquo;s like the tortoise.
Speaker 4
Decibel.
Speaker 8
In the hay, every new company is trying to beat the competitor to the punch with the latest material from Japan. We had a goal in mind when we started. We made a list of titles and went after that list. So far we have been able to acquire distribution rights to nearly every title we set out to bring to market. The strategy seems to be working. This new product, produced for the domestic Japanese market, is getting farther and farther away from the neutral international productions of the late 1980s. Following the phenomenal success of highly ethnocentric teen adventure series Sailor Moon, $250 million at last count. Most new anime productions incorporate the same sort of super deformed characters and physical gestures, which contributed to the programmes uncanny popularity. But as these gestures and design elements become more and more esoteric and obtuse, the ability of this type of material to take hold in the savvy mainstream US domestic merchandising arena is uncertain.
Craig
Of course, there&rsquo;s a number of really interesting points. Yeah, but first. You know, so I&rsquo;ll play a little clip from the Gogo 13 assassin thing for us to listen to. Just quickly now.
Speaker 4
Yeah.
Speaker 9
Leonard Dawson is the richest man in the world. Powerful people make enemies. If an enemy becomes a problem, someone calls the professional code name.
Speaker 10
Gogo, 13 Target former Nazi S captain Bernard Mueller.
Speaker 9
I&rsquo;ll take the job. He never kills for sport, he never misses the mark. And he never gets involved.
Speaker 6
Can&rsquo;t you let this one go?
Speaker 10
There&rsquo;s.
Speaker 9
But this time it&rsquo;s personal. The hunter has become the hunted because this time he&rsquo;s the target.
Speaker 10
We found Gogo Thirteens preparing to shoot Sir.
Speaker 6
Go see if you got him this time.
Speaker 10
We had him cornered, he was wounded, and yet he was never captured and the sanction the next.
Speaker 5
Time either he died or you died.
Speaker 9
I want to know who&rsquo;s really behind all this. Did you find out who ordered it?
Speaker 10
I will not tolerate it a third time. Do you understand me? That the next time you fail, it&rsquo;s what you are. We have only one enemy. The call goes 13.
Speaker 6
Cheers.
Craig
Yeah. So that&rsquo;s typical kind of adult, aimed not to your gibly or Pok&eacute;mon space, but where I think this the article talks about how. You know, will these really culturally specific? It refers to them as esoteric and obtuse gestures. So in particular it points to super deformed characters and physical gestures. In the sense of Sailor Moon, it&rsquo;s saying it it it made to the programmes uncanny popularity. It&rsquo;s very much dismissing the japaneseness of it. So my reading of this is that, you know, when it refers to highly ethnocentric teen adventure Sailor Moon and then it says, you know. The sort of super deformed characters it has, and physical gestures, it&rsquo;s saying.
Taylor
Hmm.
Craig
You know those? Those are really 2 Japanese and the questions it&rsquo;s asking here is will this material take hold in the savvy mainstream US domestic merchandise area, right. So will people want to buy your car, IE cute, you know? The deformed you know the Super deformed phrases. It&rsquo;s shibby. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Super deformed was the phrase for it 95.
Taylor
Looks.
Craig
It literally translated the kind of chibi or kawaii. Character distortion. So you&rsquo;d have a character like Sailor Moon or Dragon Ball, who maybe is portrayed a little more action oriented, but then you&rsquo;d have the Super cute version of.
Taylor
It, yeah.
Craig
Which would be kind of a squashed version. You know the eyes would be bigger.
Taylor
Yeah, less and less detail, yeah.
Craig
Do you think that aesthetic? Has in fact become. Popular do you think that the chippy? Super deformed. Anime Style is is a popular style.
Taylor
More than what? More than what they expected.
Craig
Yeah, yeah, I would agree. I would agree. My feeling here is again this is an example of the article saying, you know, that stuff&rsquo;s too Japanese and what they&rsquo;re looking for is more culturally neutral properties. That their argument being the 95 and future western market will only be successful if it&rsquo;s not too weird and other. Which I think gets it wrong. I mean, particularly if you look at Dibella&rsquo;s success, where it is culturally specific in many of their shows, certainly my neighbour Totoro, Kiki&rsquo;s well, maybe less so Kiki&rsquo;s delivery service. But there are aspects of the aesthetics of it there will be, you know, Carla E cute characters that are are kind of. Will trade there. Any do you? What would you say would be the most? Cute or? Jubilee film, right? The one which had a lot of. Merchandise or todero the Totoro creature.
Taylor
I reckon, yeah. And then all of the little other little goblin, not just the big one, but all of the small ones, which were like a lot smaller, and then they could have the life size.
Craig
Yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I think that. Became quite a popular design. For that. So yeah, I&rsquo;d say that.
Taylor
Nausica with those beasts.
Craig
Different I think those are good. Yeah. I mean, there are cute versions because no secure is a kind of Mad Max post apocalyptic wasteland space.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
Yeah, alright, well, well, we&rsquo;ve got about 5 minutes left on the show, so we&rsquo;ll push through to the end of the article.
Taylor
Ohh good.
Speaker 8
As far as Massa can streamline are concerned is in Co production and joint ventures with anime producers and rights holders. By combining the best of both East and West and new category of product will be unleashed for global consumption. Several other companies have the similar viewpoints. Manga, Entertainment, Bandai and several other companies are pre buying territories. The new anime productions Jim Lee&rsquo;s GN 13 is scheduled to hit the market sometime in 1996 as a direct to video production.
Craig
This is really interesting. So Gen 13, have you ever heard this title? So Gen 13, so they they talk a lot about Gen 13 in their SCI article saying yeah, this is the article, this is the anime. So speech to comic book series Gen 13, it&rsquo;s kind of an X man comic from Jim Lee. It&rsquo;s not part of Marvel or DC.
Taylor
No, never.
Craig
UM. In 95 they were producing it to for it to become this big adult animation from Disney that was going to be this kind of, you know, enemies creating Akira and Ghost in the Shell. Well, the West can do this with Gen 13, so there was a lot of hype on Gen 13 ended up. Not being distributed, they held it. It never had a US release. It got released in the UK and Australia on a limited release and was forgotten about. It was just dumped. It&rsquo;s fascinating looking at the Wikipedia entry for Gen 13, I mean successful comic book series.
Taylor
All right.
Craig
And they they kind of screened it at A at the Wizard World Chicago Convention in 98, and it was pulled, it never got a America release, at least according to Wikipedia. And it was considered not to have the type of Polish that people thought a Disney. Film should have.
Taylor
Right. OK. Yeah.
Craig
And it was. It was a gamble. It was, yeah, a more adult oriented kind of teen mature. It&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s the.
Speaker
Time. No.
Craig
Reminding me I&rsquo;m wrapping up. My shirt. OK, that&rsquo;s good. But it is interesting that kind of, you know, East West collaboration that they also have in this article didn&rsquo;t really pan out. You had some titles like Afro Samurai and later years, quite a few years after this, but that, that model they&rsquo;re speaking about here that the future they see in the anime business is for collaboration. Between East and West, that&rsquo;s the only way you&rsquo;ll get a huge Western English speaking market. And spin off benefits to Japan ended up being completely wrong. Yeah, right. Japan dominated after 95 with anime titles it was producing Jubilee being probably the best example of that, but many, many other Japanese based companies went on to enormous success.
Taylor
Here.
Craig
Yu-gi-oh one piece right? I mean, everything was from Japanese companies. Still, right? It wasn&rsquo;t Co produced with Marvel or Co produced with DC Comics, right? It was Japanese produced for maybe an initial domestic market that then had a a global.
Taylor
Yeah.
Speaker
Hmm.
Craig
Spin off and maybe there was a western version of it. You do the live action one piece now, 30 years later with one piece, right? But but not at all. Not at all the type of.
Speaker
But.
Craig
Success that this article prophesized well, let&rsquo;s let&rsquo;s a musical interlude, and we&rsquo;ll come back with final thoughts.
Speaker
Yeah.
Craig
Yeah. So welcome back to me, you mothership. There we go predictions. What nailed it? I mean, not much. Sailor Moon. Dragon Ball weren&rsquo;t the big properties that it was saying the future of anime is going to be defined by that ended up being a few years later with.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
Pok&eacute;mon. And and there were more misses and misfires. I think with the whole idea of the less Japanese, the product is the better you know. Again I think Jubilee. Spoke to the opposite of that. Yeah, the fact that Japan went on to have an enormous tourist boom linked to this idea of its soft power with manga and anime. You had artists like Quentin Tarantino wanting to bring in a bit of Japanese vibe with a short animated Japanese anime feature in kill Bill, right?
Taylor
Hmm.
Craig
Just having any Japanese anime vibe in there because of its cultural difference became became central. Yeah. And I think in terms of this article, you can see a lot of failure to understand the Japanese market at this point. And what was making their animation. Superior to at least a western market for an older demographic.
Taylor
And what the Western tastes would be.
Craig
As well as. Yeah, yeah. You know, I think, you know, I think Salem&rsquo;s going on to become an interesting character. But yeah, at the time it was first launched in 95, failed to get the type of success. They were hoping for.
Speaker
Hmm.
Craig
Or. So I think these days with like streaming services like crunchy roll and being able to jump between a double or a sub shows that whole kind of all animation is dubbed and therefore you know we just want to localise it into what is Western the most western of it. It shows shows it&rsquo;s different so. You know, we&rsquo;ll consider now what will be popular in. The next 30 years, yeah.
Taylor
I just reminded of my favourite dub from Pok&eacute;mon, which is I&rsquo;ll turn my trusty frying pan into a drying pan and that is a a gag which would not work in the.
Craig
I yes. Original. Yeah. Well, I I did have an honest student, Susan Cunnings shout out to Susan, fan of the show. She did her honest thesis on the.
Taylor
Oh yeah.
Craig
Western dub of Pok&eacute;mon yeah, and all the things they relabeled like Onigiri was relabeled as a doughnut. Even even though it was drawn still as as a rice ball.
Taylor
OK. Yeah.
Craig
Yeah, yeah, she she collected all these examples of just tone deaf localization efforts to remove this kind of like, you know, well, you know, we&rsquo;ll it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a cartoon or it&rsquo;s a comic. So no one will notice.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
Anyway, so let&rsquo;s let&rsquo;s media mothership for another week. Show notes are available via the podcast. Join us on discord. We&rsquo;re setting that up now. So yeah, keep listening. We&rsquo;ve got a special broadcast of arianna&rsquo;s bookshelf. Yeah, coming up that we&rsquo;ll have an interview with. With a fantastic author, so keep listening now to Edge radio.
Taylor
An unnamed.
Craig
Fantastic author. Well, I thought you had a, didn&rsquo;t you have a post saying something or the? OK, you just wanted to remind me that make sure or by 5.
Taylor
No, no. Yeah.
Craig
OK, keep listening to Edge Radio 99.3 FM.

        </div>
Craig
Yes, we&rsquo;re fun. Double the fun. That&rsquo;s a lot of media mothership happening today.
Taylor
Example. Wow.
Craig
And again again, third times a charm. Third time is a charm.
Taylor
Third time.
Craig
Alright, so you&rsquo;re listening to me. Your membership here on Edge Radio. 99.3 FM. As always, we look at everything in and around the world of media and how it shapes our understanding of the world around. Us. I&rsquo;m your host, Craig, joined by Taylor.
Taylor
Hey.
Craig
And on music today, roonan.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
Let&rsquo;s hear a musical interlude. Very cool thumb piano. Kalimba. Yeah. Playing there tunes to help us get us into today&rsquo;s topic, which is cyberpunk? Techno Orientalism, representation of Asia and the video game in particular, cyberpunk. 2077, which both Taylor and I have been playing. Yes, finally passed the. Your first act. Yeah, in my game play through, so still new, but really struck by how fascinating.
Taylor
So that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re playing.
Craig
It is, it is indeed. Yes, yes, so. We&rsquo;re going to be chatting a little bit about the generalities of Cyberpunk 2077 as well as most importantly, what I find the most fascinating aspect of it. Which is the. Representation of Asia that&rsquo;s in this game.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
So all that and more coming up soon on media mothership, we&rsquo;ll go to a short musical interlude. OK, welcome back, medium mothership. So Cyberpunk 2077 is an action RPG video game developed by CD Project React Red.
Taylor
I think it&rsquo;s.
Craig
Some would say they did wreck their launch and it&rsquo;s based on our. Talsorian ANS games cyberpunk tabletop RPG. Yep, which goes right back to I think the 90s or 80s that that tabletop RPG came out anyway, so the title of. CD Projekt Reds. Cyberpunk 2077 is is that this is the first game. We&rsquo;ve moved on to since The Witcher. Yep, so they did the witches game series, which was enormously successful and. This is quite a gear shift for them as opposed to the fantasy world of Witcher. This is as the Games title suggests, set in a cyberpunk future. Very dystopian as all cyberpunk fiction is where ultra modern technology is coexisting.
Taylor
Well.
Craig
Alongside of, you know, a human society that is suffering all manner of calamity, the location of the game is night city. Which is a Free State of California within the world building. The year, as the name of the title suggests, is 2077, so it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s our future as well. But if you&rsquo;ve played the tabletop game, you&rsquo;d know that basically this is an alternate future that started way back in the 90s. I think it started to diverge. Where? Yeah.
Taylor
But even even within the game itself, they say.
Craig
You see, Michael because.
Taylor
Even within the game itself, they talk about how certain events in the game happened in 2020, so it&rsquo;s definitely an alternate.
Speaker
Yes.
Craig
That&rsquo;s right. Yeah. So there&rsquo;s some flashbacks where a, you know, a a big tower complex is destroyed, and even that is within a far advanced technological version of our world. But it&rsquo;s not a kind of utopic technology. Future. This world is very much. As happens in all Saver Punk, we&rsquo;re looking at mega corporations, multinational corporations Akasaka in this game and militech. So it&rsquo;s the names kind of of arasaka is, as a Japanese based company within that of course the idea that.
Taylor
Mm-hmm. Had a. Sucker.
Craig
As is standard for 80s cyberpunk world building, Japan and Asia is a rising power, and in many ways eclipsing the US and the Wests Power. In this game, you do have militech as the US based.
Speaker
Hmm.
Taylor
Military technology.
Craig
Technology company. Yep. And so basically, these two organisations are pretty much managing most aspects of life. There are still functioning governments, but the real power and technology and yeah, the the political power, the technology. Your power is all based within companies.
Taylor
Yeah. And everything&rsquo;s in vending machines.
Craig
That&rsquo;s right, there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s a. Lot of have you seen? I mean you&rsquo;ve not played Cyberpunk 2077. Have you seen it online in any fashion?
Speaker 4
Yes.
Taylor
Yes, I&rsquo;ve watched the play few of.
Craig
It OK what are? Some of the things you recall from the play through Ronan.
Taylor
Ohh it&rsquo;s very depressing in some parts.
Craig
In terms of the aesthetics of the world.
Taylor
In terms of the aesthetics and the. Yeah, wealth divide.
Craig
Exactly. Yeah, there&rsquo;s quite a stark rich versus poor class divide within the game space and in many ways. You know you. Could say that in this global world, the the rich and the poor, the the only united global experiences. More so than national identities. So in the game you&rsquo;re playing a kind of St level character. You can kind of, I guess, choose from various type of of of builds for your character, like a kind of tech based build or.
Taylor
A cybernetic build.
Craig
Right to kind of tag. And it&rsquo;s a very adult game as well. There&rsquo;s sex and violent crime as well as as Ronan&rsquo;s pointing out, extreme poverty. It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s very confronting collapse of the American dream. So even though you&rsquo;re in America, there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s quite. A lot of. Of Asia, that&rsquo;s there. You&rsquo;re playing as the character V. UM, and you know, I guess you start the game trying to break into the big time, right? You&rsquo;re trying to to kind of climb out of a kind of nobody existence.
Taylor
Yeah. Well, you&rsquo;re, you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re being a Merson. Is really it?
Craig
So you&rsquo;re getting. A lot of missions you&rsquo;re going on. 1. As you&rsquo;re trying to, you know, become famous or improve your status within this cyberpunk space. Interestingly, kind of joining you on the mission is a character called Johnny Silverhand. Whose voice, likeness and motion capture were provided by Keanu Reeves.
Speaker 4
Yep.
Taylor
Your birth taking.
Craig
That&rsquo;s right. That was his fantastic experience at the sober Punk 2077 launch, where he came out on stage. and You know someone suddenly from the. Audience, what did they say?
Taylor
You&rsquo;re breathtaking.
Craig
And Keanu Reeves, without missing a beat, Jess turns around and says.
Speaker
You&rsquo;re.
Craig
So let&rsquo;s listen to that little clip now.
Speaker 5
OK, but let me tell you. The feeling of of being there, of walking the streets of the future is really going to be breathtaking. Your breath taping. You&rsquo;re all breathtaking.
Craig
So I mean, and that clips kind of.
Speaker 5
All right, all right.
Craig
Indicative of the real goodwill. That this game had leading up to its launch right? The sense that not only was this from an excellent top notch game company.
Taylor
Hmm.
Craig
That had shown itself as highly supportive of its fan base, providing a lot of free DLCS which were enormous. But also, as that launch suggests, you know, they have no expense has been spared. It seems, right in terms of voice talent being able to realise this amazing world. So it was riding high on so much positivity and from what I found online when I was looking at early reviews for years ago. Yeah, positive reviews, right. People saying, you know, this game looks good, some concerns, but it&rsquo;s beta. And I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;re going to fix it. But then what were your memories of its launch?
Taylor
Debacle. You know, this is this is a bad question to ask me because I played it on a. On a a graphics card with 6 gigabytes.
Craig
You&rsquo;re the perfect person device name. And because it was pictured at A at a kind of it we play.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
On every for every and it.
Taylor
It function perfectly. Ohh did it yeah cause that there were no issues in my playthrough.
Craig
Right. What was the? What was the story, though that that came out with its initial ones playthrough though, which your experiences not speak?
Taylor
To well, other people said that it was completely broken and they couldn&rsquo;t start playing it. It would just crash to desktop all the time. All of the intended things just wouldn&rsquo;t work.
Craig
And there was so much bad press that even Sony said. If you want.
Taylor
We&rsquo;re going to remove it from the store.
Craig
Yeah, we&rsquo;re going to move from the store and also even if you&rsquo;ve already started playing it, we&rsquo;ll refund your your.
Speaker
1st of it.
Taylor
To be fair, I played on the PC so.
Craig
Hmm. PC Master race represent, but you&rsquo;ve you&rsquo;re also playing now on the switch.
Taylor
Exactly. Yeah. To now.
Craig
Yeah, well.
Taylor
That, like man, the games and they&rsquo;re expensive. They are really expensive, but it it it operates well like it it&rsquo;s fully. There&rsquo;s no issues with it at all. However, they just brought out a new patch. Where all of the cars can self drive themselves, and apparently they&rsquo;re like.
Speaker
Yes.
Taylor
You know, driving into each other or not driving at all and issues like that.
Craig
Yes and no. I have. Yeah. And that&rsquo;s the kind of GTA many. Yeah. And many people playing at that version of the car, being able to auto drive. So you can take in the amazing visuals in this in this game.
Taylor
There&rsquo;s still issues ongoing now.
Craig
Setting. So what I want to so that&rsquo;s the kind of setup and it&rsquo;s since gone on to be very successful, I&rsquo;d say, I mean over those last four or five years, it&rsquo;s gone on to address most of those problems and now it is considered, you know, one of the best games to to play. The If you&rsquo;re into kind of action RPG games. Yeah. So I&rsquo;ve very much been enjoying it, but what really confronted me as I was playing it was how much it evoked my enjoyments growing up in the 80s and 90s. Of a particular view of what that future is gonna be like. As many people were afraid of and excited about the Asia century approach right that this was going to be the like from the 20th viewpoint of the late 20th century. So the the 90s in particular that with the rise of anime and before that in the.
Speaker
Hmm.
Craig
80&rsquo;s the dominance of particularly the Japanese automobile industry and other high tech aspects coming out of Japan that that 21st century is going to be Japan, century and Asia was on the rise. Within that was a backlash against it. Yeah. Where you had films like Blade Runner? In particular, that portrayed this future and of course drawing upon the inspiration of cyberpunk, which is Neuromancer by William Gibson.
Speaker
Sure.
Craig
That I read and. Enjoyed anyway? The sense was, though, that that there was. A A fear of Japan, a fear of. Asia, which was. Wound up in this concept, techno Orientalism. Which looks at how the West often portrays East Asia in particular, and during the 90s and 80s, Japan and China. As you know, both being hyper technological but also very weird, very culturally exotic. And so you have all these stereotypes. And anxieties about Asia&rsquo;s economic and technological dominance? I don&rsquo;t know if anyone here remembers the 1980s Michael Keaton film in Australia. It was called working class man in America. It was released as Gung Ho. But that was all about a declining America. In. Automobile factory that got bought out by a Japanese company in the 80s that wanted to come in and bring Japanese management structure and it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s got a lot of racism, a lot of culture clash, but it&rsquo;s very emblematic of that techno orientalist vibe where you have this, yes. Highly technologically developed, but all the Japanese are automatons. They&rsquo;re all soulless kind of racism within that field. Aspects of that are also in the kind of world of Blade Runner. Mm-hmm. But before we go any further, we have got some. Some comments. Ohh yeah. Good from Big Boy natty. Wonderful to have Big boy needy back on. Good afternoon. Dot Norris, dad and mysterious person in the quarter. Great. Yes, we do try to get some mysterious guests.
Speaker
Yeah.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
In. Big Boy needy asks. What&rsquo;s the gameplay like in comparison to other games like GTA5 or like Kingdom come, deliverance, etcetera. You&rsquo;ve got more experience than I do. Taylor, you want to handle this one with Skyrim?
Taylor
Yeah. Well, I would say it was. So my favourite game of all time, of course, is Skyrim, but this one comes as a close second. Because it is quite similar. However, it does have the you know the the the first person shooter thing which Skyrim doesn&rsquo;t have, and so I would say it&rsquo;s closer to GTA in that regards, but you cannot go into third person.
Craig
Yeah. And that that was part of the initial scepticism of some missteps at the time. I mean, I please find, I mean that first person many people say is is actually creates more immersiveness in the game space.
Taylor
In the game. Yeah. But it&rsquo;s only when you like put it off against which of which all of that was only third person, and those things only first person.
Speaker 4
Yeah.
Craig
The point that was made by many critics of this move was that it it just weird, given how important the coolness your character design is in the game that you get.
Speaker
Of.
Craig
So much customization for clothing and you get cool points that you can develop your character. Around and they want your character. They want you to spend time on your character design to make it look cool. But then of course you don&rsquo;t see it often in the game unless it&rsquo;s through. A mirror, yeah. Or yeah, in in passing or if you&rsquo;re jumping into a vehicle and you do that back for the backwards you. But yeah, game play is good. I mean, I go to, I mean, it&rsquo;s one of those games theorist here at UTAS, referred to it as the Ludo Drome. Yeah, where the more you play these immersive world building games, the more you can start seeing the world around you through the HUD. Right. You start seeing like I I kind of think I&rsquo;m in the cyberpunk hard or wouldn&rsquo;t it be cool if the cyberpunk card was here as I&rsquo;m walking to McDonald&rsquo;s and then they can scan people and like, you know, this is from gang X or if I&rsquo;m in the car and I&rsquo;m thinking, you know, if I.
Taylor
This is ridiculous and this is and I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking about.
Craig
Playing Grand Theft Auto or Cyberpunk 2077? I could just flip a UI right here and speed off stuff. These, I mean, I mean, it&rsquo;s a game fictional space, obviously, I know what the difference between reality and.
Taylor
Fiction is it doesn&rsquo;t sound like.
Craig
That, but then you find it. Sometimes you&rsquo;re in a hub world and you spend a lot of time there. Some people in first person shooters. Inactive. That they&rsquo;ll stop playing the game and they&rsquo;ll still see the the blip for the gun sight in their vision.
Taylor
Well, that&rsquo;s the the Tetris effect, isn&rsquo;t it?
Craig
Right, they&rsquo;ll see it. Right. Yeah. So what is the Tetris effect? For those that.
Taylor
I don&rsquo;t know you if you play Tetris for more than two hours or something like that. You start seeing.
Speaker
Please see there.
Taylor
The blocks coming down, yeah.
Craig
Yeah. And I think similarly, I mean big, Naughty Boy says. Yes. I mean kind of agree, Craig. Thank you. I&rsquo;ve experienced. Thank you. Yes.
Taylor
You&rsquo;re both mental.
Craig
Well, one of Tasmania&rsquo;s greatest living authors, shirt Taloon and his book he who fights with monsters, is all about that concept of a guy that travels through a portal to another world, and his only advantage is that he is. The world has recreated him, but given him. Video game HUD. Interface with the the world he&rsquo;s in, so he he uses a chat and he has a map that pops up and he can bring up his storage devices. I was thinking what a what a fantastic idea. If I mean I guess that&rsquo;s Google glasses, right? If you could interact with the world around you with a game hub interface. And you can get storage items out of things into storage.
Taylor
Ohh no absolutely I cause cause they&rsquo;ve got the the things that you can put in the on the dashboard of your car and it it. It flashes it up onto the windshields of like.
Craig
Yeah, it&rsquo;s.
Taylor
Direction. You need to go in order to follow. Google Maps I&rsquo;ve always wanted.
Craig
You test researcher from sociology did a project looking at gamers who played GTA back in the day, and he&rsquo;s interviewed locally here in Hobart, was asking them after the game after you&rsquo;ve played the game, does it make you see Hobart? Or in a different way, and some of them recounted that experience of. You know, I&rsquo;d like to, you know, drive down this one way St if I was in the game. So you&rsquo;re starting to see the cityscape as more international as well. One guy was saying I thought Hobart was really boring, but then I&rsquo;m playing GTA. I realised there are aspects of Hobart which I like the gang world of GTA, driving down hungry Jacks. And there were three kids, he&rsquo;d think.
Taylor
OK. Yeah, yeah. And he could have just leaped out of the car and slit their throats slight there, yeah.
Craig
That would be gang gang XI. Get the money. Obviously. We&rsquo;re saying make sure you do reality and fiction, but it made for some people. See Hobart as a world engaged globally whereas.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
As you know, there are dark parts of Hobart, just like you could do a GTA Hobart.
Taylor
This is this is just for people who have got no imagination. I&rsquo;m.
Craig
No, no, no.
Taylor
Sorry.
Craig
No, it makes the space around them more exciting through their imagination. Yeah, they&rsquo;re super imagination.
Taylor
You think about that without playing a game.
Craig
I can make.
Taylor
Whenever I drive down the street, I think about running people.
Craig
That would be more worrying to me. Alright, I wanna go back to find some key times here. So techno Orientalism, there&rsquo;s a there&rsquo;s a a clip here.
Speaker 6
What&rsquo;s the future?
Craig
Yeah.
Speaker 6
Look like this question is at the flow. Of countless people.
Craig
OK, this clip here that I&rsquo;ll play second of that just defines the key aspects of technology. So listen to this for a second. This is from my seats for an assignment they had to do for university. Good on them.
Speaker 6
So you probably know that there&rsquo;s another common element in the genre. The Asian influences. Most of the most popular cyberpunk film shows or video games take heavy influence from Asian, particularly East Asian architecture, language, culture, and more. In fact, this concept is common enough that the name techno Orientalism. Or sometimes cyber Orientalism has been made for it. But before I dive into this trope, let&rsquo;s talk about how it relates to Orientalism.
Craig
So last week on the show, we covered Orientalism. With the great. Episode of the Shadow the the Temple bills of Nabon well, I think is how it&rsquo;s pronounced within that fake Indian country. They had their other characters.
Speaker
MHM.
Taylor
Ohh yeah, the really boring.
Craig
One. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I didn&rsquo;t realise. And it&rsquo;s about to talk about here. It&rsquo;s all about a snake charmer, right? And of course, the concept of Orientalism came about through Edward Saeed and the cover of most. Hmm. Of the books. Orient was made would say feature that picture of the snake charmer, which is considered one of the classic oriental stripes because it&rsquo;s the Wests version of what the Orient is right it has these, you know, kind of your. Arabian carpets and a young boy with the snake hypnotising it and kind of 18th century sheiks in their clothing and then nonsensical writing, which is just meant to evoke it. But again, it&rsquo;s an idea of nonsensical. If you&rsquo;re actually from those regions you wouldn&rsquo;t identify. Or experience any of that painting. But from a western perspective, you have no experience of. It and that. Says Ohh, how perfectly exotic. Anyway, let&rsquo;s hear first the definition of Orientalism. Sure.
Speaker 6
Orientalism can be summed up pretty well by French artist Jean Elijah Holmes 1879, painting the snake charmer, the image and bodies, Western misguided ideas of the Orient going as far as to include writings on the wall that are in fact utter gibberish. So Orientalism, the idea was coined by Edward Saeed in 1978 as a way of referring to the general. Othering of Middle Eastern, Asian and North African societies, whereas the oxidant, the word referring to Western societies, was represented as normal and standard. The Orient was a backwards deviation from the norm. In his then controversial book, Orientalism said talks about how within writing, those from the Occident were portrayed as heroes and those from the Orient as inferior villains.
Craig
So it was very much what we had in last week&rsquo;s episode with the Shadow where the Western guy who went to India got trained up. With the special. Indian shadow techniques? Yeah, brought that back rationally, but he&rsquo;s the good guy because he&rsquo;s the white guy. And then you had the drug den Indian. Evil guys who are trying to get the, you know, the mayor&rsquo;s son hooked on opium and.
Taylor
But you have to think at that time what were the places that were in the Orient, what were their stories? Yeah. And look. And with the the the White McDonald&rsquo;s eating rice.
Craig
Yeah. And this is where the South Bank genre is is really interesting because that we finally do get that. Experience reflected back upon us, where just as we did Blade Runner, we just as American creators. Like Ridley Scott and.
Speaker
Have. A.
Craig
White Anglocentric creators, their version from a western perspective of what Asia is you&rsquo;ve got Akira and Ghost, and you&rsquo;re coming out of Japan articulating the same setting cyberpunk, but fundamentally reoriented from a Japanese point of view. Some of that is self orientalist, right? So you&rsquo;ve got some self exoticism.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
There. So you&rsquo;ve got some geisha robots, which was? Very much being that troupe of Orientalist, you know, seductive, beautiful, passive these and other.
Taylor
Also that that that&rsquo;s part of of their national identity. That&rsquo;s like having kangaroo robots, yeah.
Craig
Sure. Look, I mean it, it can be, I mean, I guess The thing is that how many people in those. Countries have first-hand experiences of. That that is it actually reflective of the lived experience which is. Of.
Taylor
Such as here with Kangaroos.
Craig
Which is where many Australians become so outraged that the stereotype that is portrayed on Australia, that it doesn&rsquo;t reflect the fact that most of us live in cities and not in the Bush equally. What&rsquo;s interesting with Ghost in the shell, for instance, is if you have a look at where they set.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
The future it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s the Japanese version of Hong Kong. So goes and the show is set in a kind of, you know, very Hong Kong looking future. Not really a Japan looking future. So they&rsquo;ve orientalized Asia in a very interesting way in that film. Big boy. Needy has replied back. Do you want to read that please?
Taylor
Says immersive gameplay does definitely make life a bit more alive after living a day to day life. Where it&rsquo;s all the same and then play GTA where you can do anything. It makes it more alive.
Craig
Which always just be interested in those farming simulators or the what&rsquo;s it like on Roblox? There&rsquo;s a number of garden, yeah. How how far are you through on that one?
Taylor
Grow. I don&rsquo;t really play it. No. OK. Wow, wow.
Craig
Yeah. OK, pushing on.
Speaker
And he lead hundreds of millions of. Men to sweep the world. And that, my friend, is what you have. Got to prevent.
Speaker 6
It&rsquo;s worth mentioning here that Orientalism can refer to the othering of a variety of places, but in this video I&rsquo;m talking specifically about Asia, and usually more specifically about East Asia. Orientalist imagery is still prevalent in pop culture, from the use of ninja costumes on Halloween to kimonos on stage, but there is debate as to whether these acts are racist. In themselves, they are almost always fantastical and inaccurate. As Pedro Jacobelli writes about a film.
Craig
So yeah, I mean it is that whole debate around, you know, your cosplay is my culture and cultural appropriation.
Taylor
But not even cosplay as well, cause I was in a theatre production in 2017 or something like that where we had it was Japan, Japan sort of themed Macbeth? If if it was like Macbeth, if it was in.
Speaker
Oh really?
Taylor
Japan really. Yeah.
Craig
There&rsquo;s a great Kurosawa film trends of blood. Which is that right? It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a samurai version of.
Taylor
Yeah, yeah, yeah. It it was that sort of sort of thing. So yeah, we learned how to do sort of like samurai sword fighting styles and things like that. We had Tycho players come in and do the soundtrack behind everything and our costumes were kimonos and yukatas. And they were sort of.
Craig
Ohh, fantastic.
Taylor
Specifically, not fantastical or anything. Well, the witches, of course, were fantastical because they were based off the one that crawls out of the TV screen the the rings, yeah.
Craig
The ring? Really. You did surgical.
Taylor
But all of the other people. So I I played a a few other different characters but all of my costume was sort of downplayed, sort of more traditional rather than fantastical.
Craig
Right. So you&rsquo;re like, you know, you cut the yeah kind of Japanese. Bathroom. Yes. So Orientalist of me to say that. But again, you know that that that would have copped. You copped some some. Friction there some, some, some some.
Taylor
We we. Yeah, we were scared about it. But yeah, there was no, no issues with it at all, because I guess we&rsquo;d had just done it in a really sort of.
Craig
Tasteful. OK. Yeah, yeah. No one there. Performing was Japanese.
Speaker 5
No.
Craig
But again, many people might. Some people would say it. It can be an effective entry point, right to provide more interest in that space or a form of soft power, right? Isn&rsquo;t it? I mean for. Instance, you know.
Taylor
You&rsquo;re talking about an effective entry point to racism.
Craig
Trying out more about the complexity.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
That really is part of Japan and I guess if you&rsquo;re upfront that this is a, as they&rsquo;re saying here, if it&rsquo;s if it&rsquo;s kind of hyper fictional and hyper stylized, often that can help avoid that appropriate.
Taylor
Yeah.
Speaker
Hmm.
Taylor
Recently.
Craig
Monkey, but yeah, well, yeah, yeah. I mean, well that in its own way was an appropriation of Chinese clothing from the Japanese point of view.
Taylor
Exactly, yeah.
Craig
UM. Yes, but again, in in the the point you were doing it was a. Little more downplayed.
Taylor
Yeah, yeah.
Craig
Very interesting if yeah, that, that, that didn&rsquo;t cop any Orientalist.
Taylor
Backlash. I&rsquo;ve got a video, but if you wanna. Watch it. It&rsquo;s good fun.
Craig
Next episode, next episode. Alright, so what&rsquo;s techno orientalism? So we&rsquo;ll quickly jump into a definition of techno Orientalism.
Speaker 6
Techno Orientalism differs a bit from Edward Saeed&rsquo;s definition of Orientalism. Instead of seeing Asia as just backwards and uncivilised, techno Orientalism represents Asia as so technologically advanced that it has no humanity. Asian people can still be framed as intellectually inferior, but the key distinction is that they&rsquo;re now also hyper technological. Making them supposedly emotionless and. Newman, in their book techno Orientalism, Imagining Asia and speculative fiction, history and media, David S Rao, Betsy Huang, and Greta Igneo write that this presents a juxtaposition of cultural retrograde with technical hyper advancement. The message of techno Orientalism is actually a little contradictory, since it portrays ancient people as both terrifyingly intelligent. As well as uncivilised and culturally behind techno, Orientalism means using Asian more specifically East Asian cultures, as a signifier of the future. This isn&rsquo;t just any future, though. It&rsquo;s cyberpunk, thus a dystopian future. These films tend to have a white guy battling against a corrupt system or corporation in a city full of indicators of East Asian.
Craig
So a couple of interesting points raised there. One of the species of it is this contradiction. So rather than Orientalism, which is set as you know, the East is underdeveloped, exotic and mystical and irrational, and the West is hyper. Enhanced and rational in techno orientalism. It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s in many. Ways flipped where Asia is. Now, the technologically advanced space. But the criticism of Azure in that space, particularly if we&rsquo;re looking at the 1980s with the rise of particularly automate of companies, is that it&rsquo;s also dehumanising that they work like robots. They&rsquo;re are kind of an ants like people that just, you know, support. Labour and again, this would be the racist discourse around othering.
Taylor
Yes.
Craig
And and the fear of of of, of that cultural other.
Taylor
Yeah, it it it. It&rsquo;s also a a Trumpian fear of the country being taken over as well, because if you look at Knight City, it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s set in America and then it&rsquo;s got all of this sort of Asian influence from it of like you.
Craig
Know and and you know within the game you could certainly criticise the. At at a sucker. Company as as emblematic of that, that that&rsquo;s a. Company which is. Very much that fear of Asian power that it&rsquo;s going to be kind of not based on Western values that will be based on this idea of a Japanese values which is full of loyalty and honour and tradition and working for the company. And you know, you don&rsquo;t mean. Anything the company means everything.
Taylor
And what&rsquo;s it called? Where it&rsquo;s fairly all piety as well.
Craig
Yeah, yeah. And again, there&rsquo;s a there&rsquo;s a. There&rsquo;s a stereotypes of experiences which don&rsquo;t reflect the lived experience. That is the complexity of the Japanese space. But nevertheless, is the stereotype there. So so aspects of Cyberpunk 2077 certainly replicate that. I just want to play though what I think is really a counterpoint for that is that you have the character of tacky murder. Right. Who&rsquo;s the bodyguard of the emperor? Right, the yeah.
Taylor
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Craig
Saka.
Taylor
The.
Craig
But there&rsquo;s a lot of his his character is quite complex, so if we listen to like I&rsquo;ll, I&rsquo;ll play a short clip of his back story. Yeah, where it&rsquo;s really conveying his humanity. Right. His sense of the struggle that he&rsquo;s had, he&rsquo;s not just a a villainous character or a.
Taylor
Dialogue.
Craig
You know, side quest. Yes, dude.
Speaker 4
I remember the chemical stench of the canal where we boys washed our shirts. Corporate transporters sometimes passed through our slab arasaka, selecting children, but only the clean ones or Osaka gave me what no one else could values I could honour live for. This was most important. You dirty your hands. Full money. I in the name of a priest.
Speaker
So as you can probably see.
Craig
So as you. Probably see sorry, that&rsquo;s actually from. A YouTube clip from the Kavanagh Cle called the anti Japanese Racism and Orientalism of Cyberpunk from Blade Runner to Cyberpunk 2077. His you choose basically ripping it apart saying it is full of racist stereotypes. He loves this world setting but he. It highly problematic and I agree with some of the criticism, as the outer cycle 1 is is pretty much playing into that trope of the villainous, you know, Shogun empire, that. But I think Tucker Tucker&rsquo;s character is is complex, is full of kind of remorse.
Speaker
Buddha.
Craig
And a sense of exploitation he&rsquo;d suffered. You know, he&rsquo;s not just a cardboard cut out villain. In fact, he becomes a a helpful guy.
Speaker
Right.
Craig
Throughout this.
Taylor
World The funny thing to me is that it it&rsquo;s negative if you frame it as a dystopia, and in many ways it is a dystopia. However, when I look in that world, I I want to.
Speaker
So.
Taylor
Be in there.
Craig
What is it about the world that?
Taylor
Appeals to you. It&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s just so. Like you know, technologically advanced, I want to be in a world that technology technologically advanced, no matter what.
Craig
Yeah, and and in. Many ways, that&rsquo;s what I was thinking about in terms of their aspects of the hub and. Your interface in that world.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
Like the net running, you can do which is where your character can. Has got various cyber cyber implants which means they can hack into security systems and be able to see through security cameras and switch them off. And again when I see security cameras like I&rsquo;ve seen a couple of security cameras walking around today and I&rsquo;ve thought wow if I was a net.
Taylor
Well.
Craig
Tanner, I could just hack into that camera.
Taylor
So that&rsquo;s why you when we went down, the thing seems like that is a good that is a good sign. Yeah.
Craig
It&rsquo;s.
Taylor
It was like the first time you&rsquo;ve ever pointed that out and we&rsquo;ve gone there 100 times and I was like, so confused you were like.
Speaker
Sure.
Taylor
CCTV camera over there.
Craig
Good location for it. That that&rsquo;s their location because you&rsquo;ve got the passion. Powerful. Gonna we be able to pick up an accident or something? And I&rsquo;m only tuned into that cause in the game whenever I come across a group of people that I need to take care of, I&rsquo;m always. Trying to find. Where the cameras are first to then hack into the cameras, locate where the rest of the people are that are going.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
To have to take care of. And then I&rsquo;ve been doing that. In real life. Yeah. Just I&rsquo;ll walk into a space and say where are the security cameras here? Yeah. And it has made me really sensitive to how many security cameras are around us. And again, that&rsquo;s part of the cyberpunk world that you&rsquo;re in a highly. Surveyed society and yeah, I agree with your sense of the fun of the immersiveness of it, that. And that&rsquo;s the punkness of cyberpunk, they say right where the cyber is. It&rsquo;s high tech, but the punk is it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s your working class, your people on the streets that are using that corporate technology. For themselves, right, so your chart. Peter gets to hack into the corporate security cameras to then use those to defend himself with.
Taylor
But of course your character can also be corporate.
Craig
Too. Well, that&rsquo;s where the power is. The ultimate power in these worlds, where where it&rsquo;s dystopic is that you know, you don&rsquo;t have a welfare system, you don&rsquo;t have anyone helping you. You don&rsquo;t have any supports in this space. The companies own you and the companies own the power.
Taylor
The thing that I really like about it is that even though it is so high tech and there&rsquo;s all of this amazing stuff everywhere, there&rsquo;s still just rubbish on the.
Craig
Ground. It&rsquo;s a really healthy world. Yeah. Yeah. Look and. And it does have that wonderfully worn world building to it. And which is why I always prefer the world.
Taylor
It is.
Craig
Building of Star Wars to Star Trek while while Star Trek is is a fantastic universe. Nevertheless, the kind of alien world the Blade Runner world, the Star Wars world is all about used technology which is partly damaged. It has storytelling within that. Big boy Nadia sent another.
Taylor
Ohh sent. Another two said, he said. I&rsquo;ve heard of people being called racist for wearing traditional Chinese outfits, whereas actual Chinese people are fine with.
Speaker
Message.
Craig
It look and that&rsquo;s one thing I found when I was looking into information about Cyberpunk 2077 and that.
Taylor
And that so some people from the future have said it&rsquo;s OK.
Craig
People in 20. We have 2077 time travellers, have said. Great people from Japan who have commented about it, as well as some of the reviews online have been positive about how the use of Japanese language is spot on in the cityscape. The the katakana and English blurring that&rsquo;s there is is more evolved than it is in Japan. Like you have hatcho and then. Kadu in karaka. So they&rsquo;ve quite enjoyed the accuracy to the the written system.
Taylor
And if if you like, stand up on the top of a building, you can see karaoke everywhere. Which is the true? Family man.
Craig
Family Mart. So there is a sense of also some sense of, you know, the the the soft power of Japan that you know in the 80s. Yes, Japan was on the rise and in many ways, maybe it was lucky they&rsquo;ve got that as a cultural soft power like the.
Speaker
Hmm.
Craig
Positive image people have of a country from around the world, far worse ones to be stuck with than than cyberpunk. I mean the Kangaroos and crocodile man hunter.
Taylor
Yeah. Like. And how about fermented fish from like Norway? Things like that.
Craig
Yeah. What about Vikings storming?
Taylor
Yeah. Yeah, exactly.
Craig
Yeah. Yeah. So in in many ways, yeah, many of the reviews of said Punk, 2077 from Japanese players and. Game reviewers in Japan were positive in terms of, much like Big Boy Natty saying not taking offence at this, but seeing it as actually yeah, culturally tuned as opposed to I guess the bad press that the Assassin&rsquo;s Creed, Japan one.
Taylor
A positive spin on it.
Craig
Where some of the lettering was wrong, where it was just there as an orientalist touch.
Taylor
And they didn&rsquo;t allow you to break grave sites either. Whatever it was.
Craig
Probably a good thing. But also the voice acting is good, right? I mean, you&rsquo;ve got a good Japanese voice acting there.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
What&rsquo;s the second point? I can&rsquo;t read it from here. Your point. It&rsquo;s depicted as a dystopia, but it doesn&rsquo;t need to be. Maybe. Make Brisbane into S Hunk city and it might be fine. Just a normal technological city. Yeah, if you did so in this environment, of course, you&rsquo;ve got Japan town. Which is kind of like Chinatown that exists in some of the largest city. Which does provide you that sense of cultural hybridity that that food is engaged with and celebrated. Were there any other? I mean, it&rsquo;d be interesting. Yeah. Cyberpunk Brisbane, cyberpunk. But.
Taylor
Cyberpunk cover.
Craig
That&rsquo;s I mean. I kind of think you could do steampunk.
Taylor
Hobarts. Ohh yeah.
Craig
Because we&rsquo;ve got. A lot of old.
Taylor
Colonial buildings. Yeah, we just don&rsquo;t have the high rises that you need for a cyberpunk city.
Craig
I mean with Dark **** it kind of gets swept away in some neon.
Taylor
I suppose.
Craig
Right, that neon scape which is I think also the pleasure of Cyberpunk 2077, is that neon cityscape space.
Speaker
Hmm.
Craig
Well, we&rsquo;ve got about two or three minutes left. So we we we might return to some of these themes in the future because I&rsquo;ve got so much more to talk about. But I mean for me, I guess the job and I have had for Cyberpunk 2077 is that they&rsquo;ve gone back to the 80s version of that world. So I I started off as a nomad. And and you&rsquo;re. Yeah, that&rsquo;s how I.
Taylor
Cool.
Craig
Roll. I&rsquo;m very mad. Max. And you start with an 80s car. That&rsquo;s been kind of mad. Max stuff a bit. And and I felt that was an immediate entry point to me in terms of this is this is a a kind of 80s as if everything went off the rails, right. Yeah. Right. So you&rsquo;ve still got a lot of that that temperament and and and and. Cultural climate from the 80s so that the version of Japan Town is very much a kind of what if Japan continued its success up as opposed to the economic downturn in Turkey in the in the early?
Taylor
90S is this funny because I&rsquo;ve I&rsquo;ve played through the game twice now, so I started off on PC and now doing switch of course. For PC I started as a Corpo.
Craig
Right. It&rsquo;s the kind of corporate.
Taylor
And. Yeah. And for switch, I did the street kids. So I haven&rsquo;t done the the Nomad 1.
Craig
Street kid the. Yeah, the Mad Max one. Yeah, right. That&rsquo;s quite an old punk.
Taylor
He&rsquo;s got a. Mohawk. Brilliant.
Craig
Yeah, it looks totally out of place in. The city, but. And I guess that would be cyberpunk. Three, which is mad. Max. Australia. Yeah, yeah, right. It actually is not neon based, but all about, you know, these these tyranny of distance deserts and your punk. Kind of. Not steam, but you know, 80s diesel technology.
Taylor
Yeah. Yeah, diesel punk.
Craig
Yeah. Yeah. Where it&rsquo;s all about, you know, you&rsquo;ve got a crossbow on your forehand and. Slightly mediaeval yeah vibe to it, but yeah, that&rsquo;s probably Australia&rsquo;s strongest sci-fi image. Yeah, Mad Max. Well, again, thanks, big Boy native been part of the conversation. One would have some audience engagement ring. You want to sign us out with the tune? Again, I think that really evokes cyberpunk.
Taylor
And it really resolved.
Craig
Resolve. Thank you so much. So thanks Taylor for.
Taylor
Being on, no worries.
Craig
We&rsquo;ll get you on with the switch and we&rsquo;ll do a live. Let&rsquo;s play some point, OK? It&rsquo;s been Craig for media mothership for another week. You can find further show notes.
Taylor
OK, sure.
Craig
Up on our.
Taylor
Podcast please, please just use the mouse on that first. Oh.
Craig
There we go. Yes, the trackball, which is very cyberpunk.
Taylor
Yeah, it is, yeah.
Craig
In in. Vibe. We&rsquo;ve got some great music coming up. Inevitably, we&rsquo;ll have Taylor show team for aeroplane.
Taylor
At some point I I need to just to just finish my website cause that&rsquo;s the whole reason I need to have people being able to send me tracks, so I need to finish the website.
Craig
Yep, Yep. Well, we&rsquo;ve been practising on the kalimba kalimba kalimba. The Kalambo Kalambo kalimba.
Speaker
Yeah.
Craig
Coming up now is FOMO by tan. By what?
Taylor
By what?

Craig
Yes, hello and welcome here to Edge Radio 99.3 FM. This is media mothership broadcasting out of Edge Radio Studios in Nepal, Luna, Hobart TAS I.
Taylor
Like how you say it like Edge radio studios like, that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s called. It&rsquo;s not. It&rsquo;s just edge radio.
Craig
Edge. Well, the thing about saying it&rsquo;s Edge Radio Studios makes it appear as if it&rsquo;s part of a media. Workshop like like the studios we&rsquo;re in. Studio A.
Taylor
Yeah, I know. Yeah, exactly.
Craig
In Edge radio complex. And we&rsquo;re exploring on media mothership as always how media shapes our understanding of the world around us. How gets it to kind of explain places we&rsquo;ve never been to. So if you&rsquo;ve only ever watched Japanese cartoons, you have, you might have a really.
Phoebe
Like.
Craig
Skewed vision of what Japan might be like. Yeah. So tonight, today&rsquo;s episode, we&rsquo;re gonna be jumping into that idea of how media particularly portrays Asia.
Speaker 7
Yep.
Craig
Before we go there, though, as always, we&rsquo;re streaming on edgeradio.org dot AU as well as on YouTube and Twitch. You can find us just by searching media mothership as well as we&rsquo;re on the DAB.
Taylor
You always say that, and no one outside of radio knows what a.
Speaker 2
Right.
Craig
Dab is if you&rsquo;re on the dab, the digital audio broadcasting system.
Taylor
If you&rsquo;re on the Deb, you don&rsquo;t know what the.
Craig
Deb is message us on SMS, yeah, directly into the studio.
Taylor
048881170.
Craig
Seven and one of our programme team members will get your message and pass it on to us, yeah. I&rsquo;m your host doctor Craig.
Taylor
Oh, we&rsquo;re going.
Craig
For the doctor, now HD, joined by Lord yes, Taylor Liston Ma, Ma Ma. So it&rsquo;s like Doctor Who. I&rsquo;m doctor. Who? You&rsquo;re the master.
Taylor
Yeah. Oh, I&rsquo;m happy with. That yes.
Craig
You&rsquo;ve been interesting iteration of.
Speaker 7
That. Thank you.
Craig
Today&rsquo;s topic. We&rsquo;re also joined by our guest Phoebe. Hey, Phoebe.
Phoebe
Hi, Craig.
Craig
Excellent. So Phoebe&rsquo;s here as a kind of litmus paper test because as we. Said. It&rsquo;s paper test. Well, just to help us stay on topic, because we&rsquo;re talking about the representation of Asia. Yeah. So she&rsquo;s going to flag us when we ourselves are committing Orientalist troops. Yeah. In our.
Taylor
When we get problematic, which?
Craig
Is pretty much going to start now.
Taylor
Yeah. So starting now.
Craig
The direction I wanted to take the show in because both of us have found that we&rsquo;re enjoying Cyberpunk 2077. Yes, so it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a video game. It&rsquo;s been out for four or five years now. I&rsquo;ve only just picked it up. It&rsquo;s set in a future. Earth in the year 2077, it&rsquo;s part of a bigger, you know franchise in. Called Cyberpunk, right, it started off as a role playing game. Of course. Before then you had Gibson&rsquo;s book, Neuromancer and so forth. But this vision of 2077 is very much a western view of a failed state environment where big mega. Companies now rural and everyone&rsquo;s getting implants and becoming half.
Taylor
Cyborgs. Yeah, yeah. The thing that it reminds me a lot of big Hero 6, actually.
Craig
Like the animated series, right, the animated movie.
Taylor
Yeah, like where they&rsquo;ve got, they&rsquo;ve got the mixture between. I can&rsquo;t remember, it&rsquo;s called something new Tokyo or something. That, yeah, mixture of Western and eastern sort of things.
Speaker 8
Yeah.
Craig
Yeah, and and it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s really interested me, the view of Asia that&rsquo;s coming out of that game and we&rsquo;ll talk about that next week, yeah. But this week what I wanted to do.
Taylor
Yeah, yeah.
Craig
Was think about.
Speaker 7
What? It&rsquo;s boring, yeah.
Taylor
Something more boots.
Craig
What are the roots? What&rsquo;s the history of that? Sync and as you know on this show we do a lot of deep dives into classic Golden Age radio. You&rsquo;re about to say.
Taylor
Something though? Or that&rsquo;s I was just going to riff on the fact that it&rsquo;s not.
Craig
A golden age, but sure. So what we&rsquo;re going to do is I thought I&rsquo;d try to find a classic radio drama which is in conversation with Asia. All right, so I found what many people were God as one of the legendary radio dramas from the 30s and 40s, which. Is the shadow. So many people might not be familiar with. The shadow but. It really was an immensely popular. Show and then became a magazine and a comic book series movie played with Alec Baldwin in the early 90s. Something some people saw. Many people see the shadow as a precursor to Batman. He shares many similarities. He&rsquo;s a kind of stealth based hero. Vigilante justice he gets trained in the Orient to 1st develop his skills and he comes back with this kind of, you know, not necessarily for the shadow mixed martial arts vibe, but this kind of mystical.
Taylor
OK. Training like Johnny.
Craig
English oh, is that the character that&rsquo;s played by? I mean, I consider that&rsquo;s a deep cut, yeah.
Taylor
Rowan Atkinson. Yeah, yeah. Johnny English reborn. He goes to, looks like somewhere in Nepal and trains with the monks there. Yeah.
Craig
It&rsquo;s that troop. It&rsquo;s that truck we&rsquo;re looking.
Taylor
You remember that?
Craig
So it is that. True of the Westerner, particularly the West. Man going to Asia, getting trained up in some kind of skills.
Taylor
Like Doctor Strange.
Craig
Doctor Strange? Yeah. I mean, it&rsquo;s full of these conventions and the shadows considered one of the earliest example examples of that trope of the person going to Asia being trained up and coming back with this mysterious Asian power. So we&rsquo;re going to break that. Apart a bit. And and have a look at at what&rsquo;s it doing through a specific episode. Would called the temple bells of Naban, which is the 5th episode Naban. Before we do that, I&rsquo;ve collected a couple of audio pieces which kind of unpack. Why the shadow is interesting to to look at just for those that maybe have never had the pleasure of listening to the shadow series. It first aired in 1937 and it went all the way through to 1954, so it&rsquo;s an incredibly long running series. It had a number of lead actors that took the role of the shadow, probably the most well known 1 is awesome. Welles played that role really early on in his career before he did Citizen Kane, which many people regard as the. Perfect movie, the best movie. We ever meet anyway, before he got to that height, he appeared as the shadow, very much to entrench himself in the American popular imagination, because the shadow was just so huge as a figure. So it&rsquo;s a mystery crime, a little bit supernatural series, although the shadow character himself. Always explains his skills as being rational, even though they sound like an invisibility skill, because the main thing the shadow is.
Speaker 7
OK.
Craig
What to do is not only crime fights as a vigilante, but he has this power to cloud men&rsquo;s minds, which means they just don&rsquo;t see him right. And he has this big black trench coat and a red scarf and this huge Black Hat.
Taylor
So how? How does he rationally explain?
Craig
That well, this is we&rsquo;ll hear this, this episode we&rsquo;re about to hear, or here halfway through the episode is a origin story, and it&rsquo;s all through this Asian trading that he attained. What many people know of the shadow is the opening spiel.
Speaker 9
OK, OK.
Craig
That he does. Or the narrator does which says you know, who knows what evil works in the hearts of men? The shadow knows, and I call after and.
Taylor
It was wait. So so I&rsquo;ve I&rsquo;ve had like at the start of some sort of song. I think it was. There was a there&rsquo;s like a. Oh no, it was at the start of a movie where they say if there is evil in this world, it lurks within the hearts of man. Isn&rsquo;t that?
Craig
OK. Yeah. Could have come from. I mean again, this is considered. This was the the slogan which launched the Shadow. In fact, that slogan used to appear on the A kind of compilation compilation. Radio drama series that he did. It became so well known that then it spun off to his own show, the shadow. So it&rsquo;s very much considered the the kind of slogan that launched the shadow into the popular imagining of America. He has a loyal companion, Margaret Lane. Lane, right. So kind of sidekick female character. And yeah, the shadow basically takes on gangsters mad scientists. You know, all typical pulp villain.
Taylor
OK. Yeah and.
Craig
Antagonists. So he has powers of hypnosis, invisibility.
Taylor
Well, how does he? How does he explain? That away, then?
Craig
Well, he says it&rsquo;s just his skill of being able to throw his voice. So he has this ability through his voice. He does have a ring, right. And as part of his kind of.
Speaker 2
OK.
Craig
Costume. He has this ring, which is meant to have some some kind of power, but again the idea here is that, as this Orientalist 5 sets up, he&rsquo;s also a kind of, you know, rational Westerner engaging with a mysterious Asian right. So he got these skills. Mysterious Asia, but as a rational Westerner, he&rsquo;s able to perfect them through his rationalism. OK, yeah, so it&rsquo;s very much that kind of Orientalist hope. So we&rsquo;ll break down some of these type of Orientalist narratives in this famous, you know, crime, pulp hero, drama series. The shadow shadow. Well we go. Let&rsquo;s say let&rsquo;s have. So we. So we have a little musical include. Yeah. V you&rsquo;re on music duty today.
Taylor
That&rsquo;s fantastic. Well, that&rsquo;s so much better than what?
Craig
Thank you. You&rsquo;ve done in the best, most talented music we&rsquo;ve played on that it&rsquo;s amazing what that thing&rsquo;s capable of.
Speaker 7
Wow. Wow.
Craig
Gee, OK, so all right, so I want to show play a short excerpt from a radio drama documentary that covers the history of a famous radio drama Guy ***** Brown.
Taylor
Just go to bed.
Craig
In episode 4. They talk about the impact. Of the shadow. So oops, sorry. Hold on, let.
Speaker 7
Me just queue.
Taylor
It up. You can&rsquo;t do this on.
Speaker 11
Oh.
Craig
Air no build suspense. Just make the shadow.
Taylor
OK. Ohh God. OK, here we go.
Speaker 9
On a night like this, then?
Speaker 3
No Washington assignment for me, no ridiculous detecting for you.
Speaker 4
I love it.
Craig
It&rsquo;s a great harm.
Taylor
And organ. Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 12
And of course, the shadow the show my mother starred in, it was adapted from a series of Pope novels written by Walter Gibson in the storyline wealthy Playboy Lamont Cranston has travelled to the mysterious E old Time radio, was filled with cringe, making tropes like this. There he encounters a Mystic who teaches him.
Speaker 10
The hypnotic power to cloud men&rsquo;s minds, so they cannot seem.
Speaker 12
This is useful if you decide to set up as a crime. Fighter. The shadow reveals himself to lowlifes with a menacing laugh.
Speaker 8
Oh, no. What evil lurks in the hearts of men? The shadow knows.
Speaker 12
The show had a number of false starts with different actors, but established itself with the casting of Orson Welles as the main character. Cranston and his mind penetrating older ego. My mother&rsquo;s role have I made mention of this before? Was the lovely Margot Lane, the attractive confidante of the Playboy?
Speaker 9
The three men you tell me.
Speaker 8
About they look like gangsters, alright?
Speaker 13
Yes, ma&rsquo;am. Yeah. And usually in mortal enemies, but tonight it looks very much as if they&rsquo;re banding together.
Speaker 8
I wonder why of you then why you come here and expose yourself?
Speaker 13
And mad because they&rsquo;re afraid of memes. They&rsquo;re only afraid of me as the shadow I do not know. Lamont Cranston. Oh, who? Who are they?
Speaker 12
Mum knew Wells already. They both toured with the successful production of the Barretts of Wimpole St They were buddies, they were friends. She thought highly of him and also sort of giggled at him a lot because she thought he was very full of himself. But Mum wasn&rsquo;t the first Margot Lane, although the character was.
Craig
All right, so. As that sets up it&rsquo;s character based in Pulp Fiction, it became immensely popular. There was a documentary series done on the shadow. And we&rsquo;ll listen to some excerpts from here as the cast and key production talent of the shadow kind of breakdown. What the series did that made it so influential. Ohh, just cute. Oh, going too far. Hold.
Speaker 14
On that succeeded in the media of the imagination.
Craig
It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s tricky with this.
Speaker 14
He was.
Speaker 7
Small little mobile phone to *** ****. Alright, hang on.
Speaker 14
The shadow. Is from Maine to California. The shadow endures today as the dominant symbol of mystery drama during radios Golden Age in the 30s, forties and early 1950s.
Speaker 15
Two years ago, I was in the hospital for an operation. And the resident Doctor Young resident came running up to my. Room to meet me. Because he he knew that I had been associated with the shadow which everybody knows. I mean, they may not have heard anything else about. But radio, but everybody knows the shadow.
Speaker 9
It could never have succeeded in television. It it, it was the marvellous thing of what what people conjured up in their minds, and then they could see the shadow, and they could see Margot and so forth. I think it would have been a terribly dull television programme.
Speaker 14
What creative forces moulded the shadows? Tremendous popularity. Why, after nearly 60 years, is the programme not only remembered fondly but still being aired on many radio stations across the nation? Who were the people that shaped the character&rsquo;s success? We&rsquo;ll take an in-depth look.
Craig
So they&rsquo;ll breakdown then what the key aspects of the shadow are, but what I want to jump to, there&rsquo;s a really there&rsquo;s a couple of really interesting parts of the whole document goes about now and we&rsquo;ll put the link to it in the show notes. There&rsquo;s a couple of aspects to it, which is really fascinating. Here&rsquo;s 1 little clip. About the the struggle of doing radio because it sounds so corny. When you listen back to it, particularly today. So of course we mainly engage with storytelling through movies and TV. One of the trouble, one of the difficulties, one of the challenges of doing audio only storytelling is you have to sometimes over explain what&rsquo;s happening because the audience can&rsquo;t see it. So it&rsquo;s. Yeah, there&rsquo;s a snake coming straight for me, and it&rsquo;s being lifted from the the the crates, then the hands coming down now, too. So there&rsquo;s a nice little section here where they talk about how dated. Listening to episodes are from the shadow, we&rsquo;ll have a listen to the episode shortly. But it&rsquo;s interesting that even the voice actors. When they hear it back now kind of cringe or recognise how.
Speaker 14
The programme demonstrating the caring, the concern a true star, often feels for the success of his enterprise.
Speaker 11
Funny it is.
Speaker 16
The people looked the. Way you wanted them to look. The places look the way you imagine them and now with television, it&rsquo;s feta compli. I mean, you accept it, and if you don&rsquo;t like it, you turn it off and go to something. House. But that was the beauty of radio it it helped to stimulate the imagination and. In comparison, now they sound very corny. When you listen to some of these old shows. Because we&rsquo;ve made such tremendous strides. Technically, and also performance wise. In radio, everything had to be spelled out in large capital letters so that, you know, I&rsquo;ve got you covered with this gun, you know, so that it was clear to the audience what was happening. Which today makes it seem kind of corny, but that was the beauty of radio. And that&rsquo;s the thing that I think is is missing in our entertainment today.
Craig
It&rsquo;s interesting also that point when you&rsquo;re at a disruptive media technology moment. So here we have people trained and made their professional career in radio. Bemoaning what&rsquo;s been lost because of the popularity now of television. Yeah, right. So, of course, this was recorded in, like the 60s and 70s, and this documentary, and they&rsquo;re talking about what it was like creating audio, which they see was better because it had to be more imaginative. You had to do that theatre of the mind.
Speaker 16
Hmm.
Craig
Work and efforts to visualise what&rsquo;s happened.
Taylor
So with the advent of TikTok, what have we?
Craig
Lost. Well, exactly. Now we have similar ballooning of what we&rsquo;ve lost from, I&rsquo;d say AI right, people saying, you know, we&rsquo;re becoming Dumber because we&rsquo;re relying too much on AI. And when entertainment is generated through AI. It&rsquo;s a lesser quality product than when I worked in media before AI, where it was all human creativity. Similar thing happening now. I think in terms of disruptive technology of AI causing people, particularly those that establish their professional careers pre AI to say, you know we&rsquo;re losing.
Taylor
Out. That just reminds me of when I talked about what was it, study gate or whatever it was and that.
Craig
Ah yes.
Taylor
Had all of the. The professional what&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s the code where you&rsquo;ve got read by other people?
Craig
Peer review.
Taylor
Peer reviewed AI? Yeah.
Craig
Yeah, yeah. Episode 87. Listen back chat, GBD.
Taylor
Found in heaps of.
Craig
Them I look, I have fantasies of time travelling with ChatGPT going back in time and just being a sensation. Anyway, that&rsquo;s my own fan fiction. I&rsquo;ll be doing like.
Taylor
I just like to say to the person who&rsquo;s on Twitch.
Craig
Yeah.
Taylor
Saying and it it it, they&rsquo;ve given me a message. I&rsquo;ve received the message, but I&rsquo;m not going to read it out.
Craig
Right. We&rsquo;ve got some comments. Wow. All right, so thank you always for audience engagement. Please keep it coming.
Taylor
Yeah. Yeah. Thank you, Nathan. Or big Nate as he&rsquo;s.
Craig
Known Nate. Alright, thanks, big Nate. All right, so the next little segment I want to play is the the the cast of the shadow talking about. When the fan audience of the shadow started to blur reality and fiction. OK, so as we do in this show, we often look at moments where. Media blurs reality where people understand reality through media, and it&rsquo;s amusing that you know there, there there are moments where that confusion gets really even superhero characters where you think these this is just Pulp Fiction. Superheroes, really. No one thinks it&rsquo;s real. It&rsquo;s a fun little comment here where they where they. Say, oh, some people thought it was real, OK?
Speaker 14
He&rsquo;s with the shadow as host prior to his becoming the central character. Of the 700 programmes that featured Lamont Cranston, about 200 are known to have survived, and of these, around 100 are available commercially on disc. The 200 programmes in circulation, either commercially or traded among collectors, are fairly evenly divided between performer.
Craig
Sorry, that wasn&rsquo;t. The clip let me find it. Hold on.
Taylor
But.
Speaker 16
They&rsquo;re able. To.
Speaker 7
Then.
Speaker 16
Drop on their.
Speaker 14
Line recently, Grace Matthews recalled how she felt auditioning for the part of Margo Lane in 1946.
Taylor
Just hold.
Craig
On here. OK.
Speaker 16
But he also had the power of Orson Welles.
Speaker 14
For several years in the mid 40&rsquo;s, the shadow programme originated before a live theatre audience. Brett Morrison typically went the extra mile in scenes where Cranston became the shadow and solely for the benefit of the theatre audience. As the radio audience could not see him, Morrison would Don his own Cape and slouch. That to match the appearance of the shadow as he was depicted in the Shadow magazine. Mean. In preparing this programme, we talked with more than a dozen of Morrison&rsquo;s contemporaries on the shadow. Not one had anything but praise for this fine actor.
Speaker 16
This is quite amazing, but you&rsquo;d be surprised how many adults actually thought that Lamont Cranston was a true character who had the power to make himself invisible because toward the end of the programme, or somewhere around? I think when we were in Korea. Yeah. We would receive letters. I&rsquo;d receive letters to people saying. We think it&rsquo;s a crime, that you&rsquo;re keeping the shadow here when he could be spying for our country, you know, again. Ohh yes. Really.
Speaker 4
Really.
Speaker 16
I had no idea that that I&rsquo;ve I&rsquo;ve seen this happen. Identity happen in daytime radio, you know, with characters they they think they actually exist and it&rsquo;s I don&rsquo;t know how they they correlate the time element that that a certain time they&rsquo;re able to eavesdrop on their lives recently grace.
Speaker 9
Isn&rsquo;t. Amazing. Yes, yes, yes.
Craig
It&rsquo;s an interesting point that during the Korean War, when the shadow was broadcast. There were messages coming through letters from fans saying, you know, it&rsquo;s a crime that the shadow, the shadow person, isn&rsquo;t over in Korea helping to win the war by using his powers to spy on the enemy, forgetting this as a fictional character, right. I&rsquo;ve heard this in terms of. Like superhero movies during World War 2, certainly, DC, for instance, never engaged with stories of fighting the Nazis. Yes, there&rsquo;s no episodes where Superman or. Or Wonder Woman, the DC heroes for the Nazis, or the Japanese enemy because they didn&rsquo;t want to diminish the real struggle that real people were facing in the war. That if you&rsquo;ve got someone as super powered as Superman, yes, he would finish the war. But obviously we can&rsquo;t.
Phoebe
Hmm.
Craig
In a.
Phoebe
But.
Craig
Fictional story. Have the war ending when you know GI&rsquo;s are going out, dying every day to win this. So instead they just didn&rsquo;t have storytelling about the the fantasy power of Superman. Here. On the other hand, you have fans then saying, you know well, why don&rsquo;t you send Superman over there to to beat Hitler because. You know, you really need everything, forgetting it&rsquo;s a fictional character. Yeah, like the shadow. The last little segment I wanna play was. It&rsquo;s really fascinating. Like we think about toxic fandom as a modern problem, right? Like George RR Martin constantly getting hassled by fans to release his show. His final episode, final story. There&rsquo;s a great segment. Here where they talk about the toxic fandom that they&rsquo;ve experienced them. Mouths in their professional careers, on the shadow, and it&rsquo;s very similar to. In fact, it seems worse than the problems that we&rsquo;re facing today, particularly the types of toxic behaviour of fans towards the female cast members.
Speaker 9
Cart was going, he was away over most, most all weekends. He went up to Canada to. To. Do the Imperial oil hockey broadcast and he&rsquo;d leave on Friday night and come back Monday morning. And of course, the shadow was on Sunday, so you know, I was there alone, and I had these kids who would phone up and really at first it was kind of fun. They say, ohh. Michael, we&rsquo;ll meet you in the cemetery or something like this. But then finally it got a bit scary and then they would come around to our apartment and lift signs all over with. Kind of. Nasty words and stuff. It was just it got too much, you know. But mostly the the mail was marvellous. It was. It was a great response. I don&rsquo;t know. I mean, you certainly have daytime soap. You got a lot of male soap, but I think it was equally as as big.
Speaker 14
Miss Matthew was recalled.
Craig
So there we go. That toxicity, that faces many fans towards even stars from the Golden Age radio in the 30s. These. Alright, so short include with some music.
Speaker 7
Nice.
Craig
So we&rsquo;re back now, and let&rsquo;s jump into an episode. So we&rsquo;ve kind of set up what the shadow is all about. Crime fighter, immensely popular series. Some people confused from actually being a real person with great powers. I want to jump now into Season 1 Episode 5 with Orson Welles playing the main role. Of the shadow. And it&rsquo;s an episode called the Temple Bells of Naban, first aired October 25th, 1937. It has an entry in TV tropes right? The key tropes that are in this episode is anti magic. The temple bells of Naban, the title of the show. They&rsquo;re actually a charm. Possessed by the antagonist Saudi, and it allows her to defeat the mystical powers of the shadow. Right. That&rsquo;s the first St second rope is drugs are.
Speaker 12
That.
Craig
Right. Because the whole narrative hinges on a heroin drug ring, right? It&rsquo;s incredible to me to think there&rsquo;s a 1937 radio drama directly addressing heroin drug rings. So it&rsquo;s a heroin drug ring that gets a wealthy capitalist son. Addicted and that draws in the attention of the shadow to help save the sun. It&rsquo;s an origins episode. So in this episode we&rsquo;ll hear how Laman Lamont sorry, the main character explains to Margo. That he learned his powers by studying with an Indian priest, the keeper of the Temple of Cobras in Delhi. Wow. So I&rsquo;m sure that&rsquo;s the thing. If we&rsquo;ve typed into Google Maps, we&rsquo;d find that so obviously highly oriental is there, and Margo suggests that he come out into the open as a crime. Right. To which Lamont further explains that he, however, instead operates in the secret as the shadow, for fear that if he did go public, others would learn his secrets that he got from the temple of Cobras in Delhi and used them for evil. There&rsquo;s also the final trope is the snake. Karma trope, again highly oriented horse trope.
Speaker 7
M.
Craig
The main character, Saadi Ben Arda, is an exotic dancer and snake charmer, so yeah, very orientalist, who can use her skills to make a Cobra attack. Of course, in this episode what she doesn&rsquo;t bargain for is that shadow has, as we&rsquo;ll see in the final twist. Small spoiler here switched out her trained cobra with another one and she gets bitten and died. Died dies. Yeah, so it&rsquo;s a great episode basically. Again, it&rsquo;s a nefarious drug ring which is selling dope on the streets of new.
Taylor
Well, there we go.
Craig
They&rsquo;ve made this mistake, though, of ensnaring the son of a VIP and the VIPs demanding action be taken by the police commissioner to save his rich druggies, hunt a bit of origins, some great classics. Fighting. So what we&rsquo;ll do is we&rsquo;ll break it down in terms of some key motifs as well as just broadly before we jump in this idea of exoticism that&rsquo;s in this episode. So this is really peak. 30s Asia exoticism right you have this idea of the main antagonist to a rational Western shadow character. The main antagonist is Saudi Ben Arda, right, an exotic female dancer and snake charmer, right? So it&rsquo;s a heavy trope that aligns with this. Idea of the imaginary Orient. She&rsquo;s also not just. Is she a? Foreigner from India. She&rsquo;s also a mystical person. She&rsquo;s seductive and super dangerous. So again, if if anyone&rsquo;s an Edward Saeed fan who coined the term Orientalism, they&rsquo;ll know this is the classic thing. Saeed says embodies the western fantasy of the east as this irrational and sensual object. Said would argue that.
Taylor
Mm-hmm.
Craig
The character of Saudi Bernarda that we&rsquo;ll listen to in a second. Isn&rsquo;t reflecting a real person from Delhi? There&rsquo;s probably no real person from Delhi that&rsquo;s like this character, Saudi Bernarda. But it&rsquo;s all about Western desire and western fear that we&rsquo;re seeing. So we&rsquo;ll we&rsquo;ll get into some of the setup of the episode and I&rsquo;ll interrupt as certain. Classic Orientalist tropes kick off. OK, so here we go. Let me queue it up. Here we go.
Phoebe
Yeah.
Speaker 17
Safe, healthy and economical fuel, then by all means you can recognise her.
Craig
We&rsquo;ll skip the promo at the. Start here we go.
Speaker 3
They still shadow The Dells of never. They will reveal you.
Speaker 1
Your third mistake, Saudi and your last.
Speaker 3
No, it is your mistake and your last. This is the end of your career as the shadow.
Craig
So that, of course was a little bit of a prelude. The female voice there of Adi Bin Sada, who&rsquo;s the antagonist very much. The opposite of Lamont. The shadow. In terms of the save the cat setup, OK, we&rsquo;re going to start with the 1st 30 seconds, which is a classic kind of. You know, we had a kind of a bit of a classic eerie theme there that we&rsquo;re hearing.
Taylor
Oh yeah, talking about the case.
Craig
And we&rsquo;re going to get the theme set up now around the intro. So we&rsquo;ll listen to how they set up the characters of Lamont and Margo Lamain. Margo lane. Sorry, in this normal world. So it starts in the normal world as they&rsquo;re talking to go to a radio drama. Sorry, a. Theatre plane, yeah.
Speaker 2
Large evening a couple of hours at the club. Caleb does. That intrigue you?
Speaker 4
Lovely, but not too late. I have an appointment at 10. In the morning at the Women&rsquo;s club. They&rsquo;re trying to get them action on this terrible narcotics situation and it stops being peddled all over town. They found schoolchildren using it, society women. Why? It&rsquo;s already called the half dozen suicides.
Speaker 2
Yes, I read about that. I know it&rsquo;s terrible.
Speaker 4
Stuff need the shadow to get at the bottom of it.
Speaker 2
As I know, dear. But for tonight I I do enjoy just being myself. Lamont Cranston. Dilettante. That&rsquo;s be the shadow. Only in real emergency. You know the. In China, there&rsquo;s a lovely Indian dancer at this new club, Caleb.
Speaker 12
Indian dancer.
Speaker 2
You know, there&rsquo;s the place just there have killed driver, yes.
Speaker 4
Lamont, you are going to do something about. It you&rsquo;ll start.
Speaker 2
It already, perhaps. Yeah, we are right. Drive up. What? Thank you, Sir.
Speaker 4
Ohh, that looked like young. Jerry Clayton just going in, yes.
Speaker 2
I was that young man&rsquo;s father. I&rsquo;d spank him and keep him home occasionally.
Speaker 4
Spoiled son of a wealthy style.
Speaker 2
Yeah. Let me have your code. I&rsquo;ll check it with mine.
Speaker 4
Good evening, Jerry.
Speaker 10
Oh. Oh, hello, Miss lane.
Speaker 4
Good father and sister. Well, I haven&rsquo;t seen them lately.
Speaker 10
Yes, yes, I&rsquo;m sorry, but I can&rsquo;t wait right now. I&rsquo;ve got to see someone, and it&rsquo;s important. I&rsquo;m sorry.
Speaker 2
Hello.
Speaker 4
I don&rsquo;t know if you don&rsquo;t get upset about something. He doesn&rsquo;t look well, either pale and shaky.
Speaker 2
You&rsquo;re right, it doesn&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m curious about that boy.
Phoebe
Umm.
Speaker 2
Well, let&rsquo;s go in.
Speaker 17
And show you to the tables.
Speaker 4
There&rsquo;s someone getting up. To speak, we seem to just in time. For the main attraction.
Speaker 17
Ladies and gentlemen, we take pleasure in presenting the fascinating and beautiful dancer of the Far East, Sadie Bell. Her first number tonight, she will give you the dance of the Cobra. Zadie Bel? Ada.
Speaker 4
Look, she&rsquo;s lovely.
Speaker 2
Yes, real thing too real Hindu.
Phoebe
Hmm.
Speaker 2
That&rsquo;s odd you. Know.
Speaker 3
Look, she&rsquo;s taking.
Speaker 4
A snake out of that wicked bat.
Speaker 2
A live cobra.
Speaker 4
Oh, heaven.
Speaker 2
Another Cobra is connected with the old Indian mysticism, the most ancient of magic. See how she quiets. The snake makes its way to the motion of her hens. It&rsquo;s a form of mesmerism. They never improved on it with all our modern psychology.
Speaker 4
I hope it&rsquo;s there within remote.
Speaker 2
Well, they undoubtedly have. Ohh. This is the one they call Saadi bin Lada. Jerry Gleason, with that strange look in his eyes. An epidemic of narcotic smuggling. Saudi bin laden.
Speaker 3
What is who she is.
Speaker 4
She keeps looking over here. Lamont. Yeah.
Speaker 2
It&rsquo;s coming this way well.
Speaker 3
You will need for the beautiful lady star. Oh.
Speaker 4
Oh, a bracelet. Thank you.
Speaker 3
Ohh, you know the tongue of Mother India? Sad.
Speaker 2
Only enough to make a small prayer only enough for that.
Speaker 13
Sadly, bell ada.
Speaker 3
It is good sometime to know a small prayer.
Speaker 2
Hmm, just in case of an emergency.
Speaker 3
Yeah. You are very welcome in case you should meet someone who could destroy you. Bella.
Phoebe
Just.
Speaker 4
What did she mean by that?
Phoebe
I.
Speaker 2
Don&rsquo;t know exactly. Funny something. She seems to know something about me. And trying to recall where I&rsquo;ve seen that face.
Phoebe
Yes.
Craig
So the story. Keeps building up as there&rsquo;s more revelations of the drug crime that&rsquo;s going on and turns out that main protagonist there that was introduced. The female Mystic Saudi Bernarda, the snake charmer is in. Cahoots with the local? Port captain and they&rsquo;re importing all of this heroin into New York and getting wealthy claim until hooked on it and then scamming them for their money. What&rsquo;s really interesting there is, again, establishing that the protagonist, antagonist tension is built around that Orientalism, right? You have the protagonist, the shadow, the Western trained superhero who went to India to get his his skill set. Who&rsquo;s here confronted with someone that. That seems to know what he&rsquo;s about. Never met them sadly bin Laden, but seems to understand and, you know, is the opposite. The antagonist, you know, mystical, seductive, dangerous. You&rsquo;ve got this kind of rational West, right? So who&rsquo;s talking about the power of mysticism and the power of the snake charm? Even we in our in the West have not been able to control this hypnotism verse because it&rsquo;s this versus this irrational.
Taylor
Yeah. We&rsquo;ve got another comment on the Twitch.
Craig
Eastern other.
Phoebe
Great, yes.
Taylor
And it says and and I&rsquo;ll let you answer this one. What is the topic of discussion today? I&rsquo;ve got this on in the background whilst I play Flight Flight simulator and I have no clue what&rsquo;s going.
Craig
We&rsquo;re deep diving into a classic 1930s and 40s golden age of radio drama called.
Taylor
The shadow on Edge radio. No, no, no one.
Craig
Of them. And we are unpacking how this late 30s episode in particular sets up some really fascinating Oriental. Images of Asia that were commonplace in the West at that point because both of us have been getting into Cyberpunk 2077, and it has. The kind of 80s view of the Asian other. So we&rsquo;re looking at what the 1930s Asian other was. So in this case the antagonist is this kind of, you know, feminine presence. She&rsquo;s irrational. We&rsquo;ll skip to the end where this kind of barbaric. Other is coming into place because the shadow of course, is a rational, civilised, masculine figure, whereas Ali bin Laden is an irrational, barbaric, feminine figure. So let&rsquo;s listen to the end as the final conflict occur. So basically leading up to this, we&rsquo;ve had a series of story beats. If we&rsquo;re breaking this down instead of in terms of Blake Snyder&rsquo;s classic, save the cat narrative, the theme gets stated there, right? The shadows power. Of invisibility and hypnotic suggestion seems to have met its match in Ali bin Laden right. The snake charmer seems to understand what what his power set is. It seems to have a deeper understanding of it. Possibly. Yeah, right. So there&rsquo;s a setup, the catalyst. There&rsquo;s a murder that occurs at the end of Act one, which then draws the shadow in to try and solve what this murder is about. It&rsquo;s linked to the drug trade that&rsquo;s going on. Then the reveal is that Ali been in such.
Taylor
Bin laden. And you&rsquo;re gonna say it, Osama bin Laden.
Craig
Bin Laden has this necklace that has the temple bells of naban in it, right? It&rsquo;s twinkle thing that will basically counter the shadow. Those ability to become invisible. All right. Again, all kind of mystery as to how that occurs. There&rsquo;s a bit of fun and games. The shadow looks like the bad guys are closing in on him. And how is he going to?
Speaker 7
M.
Craig
Counteract the power set of the antagonist. All seems to be lost. We hit The Dark Knight of the soul points, or it seems that the shadow won&rsquo;t be able to defeat her because he can&rsquo;t use his normal hidden skill advantage that he&rsquo;s going to dig deeper.
Speaker 7
Hmm.
Craig
To outsmart her. And then we head into this finale where the the character of Sada bin Laden Ada is defeated. So let&rsquo;s jump into that now and we&rsquo;ll have a listen to that, and then we&rsquo;ll break it down in terms of. Some of the key orientalist tropes.
Speaker 11
No one can get through those, not even a shell. Save your love, whoever you are, we&rsquo;ve got you. You&rsquo;re in this cabin somewhere, and this ship is outward bound. Laugh that.
Speaker 1
I think you may have made three mistakes, Captain. One too many. Yes, captain.
Speaker 3
But I do not make mistakes that.
Speaker 1
That remains to be seen, Zade villada.
Speaker 3
Then you will see. And with the weaker basket like.
Speaker 14
What do? You want to do? Yes, daddy.
Speaker 3
I call the temple bell the Niban captain. The shadow has the power to blind your eyes, but trick he learned in India from a Yogi who was my uncle. But I have a better trip. When the last bell sounds, while the sacred Cobra dancing, you will see the shadow only at the man. Be ready to shoot, Captain.
Speaker 11
I&rsquo;m ready.
Speaker 3
And now my cobra to dance with the bells of Nevada.
Speaker 1
I wouldn&rsquo;t open that basket if I were you, Sadie Villada.
Speaker 3
You watch my pretty COBRA sale. He may find you even before the captain&rsquo;s bullets. You will die just as quickly.
Speaker 1
Dead cobras are better plaything than live ones.
Speaker 3
Make your small prayer style. And now my pretty one, digging good done.
Phoebe
Be careful.
Speaker 11
The Cobra moves towards you.
Speaker 3
My own pretty cobra, he knows me. You hear the bell shadow? The temple bell.
Speaker 1
I hear them.
Speaker 3
When the last cell right? We shall see our prisoner.
Speaker 11
And I am waiting for that minute. I&rsquo;m sorry.
Speaker 17
Sadly.
Speaker 15
Sorry.
Speaker 1
The shadow warned you, Sade bin Laden.
Speaker 11
You take credit, but they still.
Speaker 1
Do you know? They should have known it was not her cobra in the Wicker basket. It was mine.
Phoebe
Use.
Speaker 14
Dead.
Speaker 11
What&rsquo;s that? Who is it?
Speaker 17
The police reported. No. Please. Captain Malin, you do not shoot.
Craig
All right. And that&rsquo;s not the police breaking into the studio. We&rsquo;re not being taken off air by a sudden interruption of the police. But at the end of the 1930. 8 episode. Of the shadow called the temple bells of Naban, I do like that moment where I mean, maybe on the comments for this video of the temple built, many people complained that the the character of Sada Bernarda is is really good. It&rsquo;s a good foil to the shadow because again, much like there&rsquo;s Orientalist. Oops, it&rsquo;s the antithesis. While the shadow is this rational masculine figure. You are kind of hyper rational here. We have this kind of mystical, seductive female dangerous other. Who can confront him? Who can call him out on his mysticism? Because she&rsquo;s trained in the same stuff and better at it with her snake. So of course, how does he get around? How does he get around the snake? He uses his rational detective skills to switch out the snake, and she is. Then bitten by her own hubris, her own feeling that she has power over the snake. To to die and. Unfortunately, killed off as a as a as a. Villain. Yeah, in that episode. Yes. So we have some nice kind of mysticism, heavy preparation of the eastern wisdom idea. I reckon you could do a counter reading of that where instead of. You know, like the the rise of the the colonial oppressed because obviously here we have the the colonial appropriation of knowledge that the the the skill of Lamont is that idea that he&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s gone to India, Tindall. These skills the West has absorbed eastern wisdom. But stripped it. Of all its context, right and reduced it down to, you know, just a kind of, you know, in terms of. The antagonist kind of villainous backwards character, but you could convert that she could, you know, triumph for the other. Possibly. I mean it&rsquo;s one of the limitations I guess, of the Western imagining that this is very much the western point of view. Would an Indian story be different, you know where the shadow is actually the bad guy?
Taylor
So at the moment my mind is just drifting away from what you&rsquo;re saying because you were talking about East and West and then that just reminded me of when we were in Japan together and we had cheats.
Craig
OK.
Taylor
Always cheater. That was at KFC, KFC and we had chicken pizza.
Speaker 11
Yes, right.
Taylor
When my mind was.
Craig
Going well. Look. Yeah, I think that&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s an interesting point in terms of I think that. Yeah. OK. So I think that&rsquo;s really a good point to end on. Yeah, because what I find really fascinating is here we have Western stories about Asia, right? So the character. Of the shadow. Is he refers to India, he refers going to India becoming mystical. We&rsquo;re introduced to an Indian character, the snake charmer, dance woman. But it&rsquo;s not written from their point of view right? Then you can have.
Speaker 17
Hmm.
Craig
Moments where what does that? Subjective other. In this case India. But in our case, Japan. Do when it takes the West. Yeah. Right. So for the KFC Western food. They don&rsquo;t treat it as what we would eat in the West. They recombined it, rehydrated it into a chicken pizza.
Speaker 7
Yeah, yeah.
Taylor
Chicken pizza pizza.
Craig
Pizza and next week we might get around to it if we have some time with the idea of Cyberpunk 2077 equally was started as. Western imaging. Of the rise of power in Asia. So you had a dominant Japanese automobile industry in the 70s. You had a dominant Japanese economy that was in many ways fearful from the West, right? The West was seeing it as a power source. That it couldn&rsquo;t. Triumph against sins in terms of automobile. Sales, technology quality and other things. So they started doing this cyberpunk stuff about what a horrible, dystopic world this is headed into, but then you have Akira Ghost in the Shell films made in Japan for a Japanese audience, which instead of taking the kind of, you know, where I kind of subjugated other, recenter it as they&rsquo;re the main characters in that. That Orientalist fantasy and.
Taylor
What reminds me what? What does? What does? What does Vietnam do when the West goes into view?
Craig
Yes. Yeah, all these and more.
Taylor
Because because because the French go go.
Craig
In Yep, the colonial.
Taylor
Period. And then Vietnam takes the baguettes and the mayonnaise and puts it everywhere. Yeah.
Craig
Right. So one can have these hybrid cuisine moments. Yeah. Yeah. Look, and I think food is probably the most constructive. Globalised. Yeah. Consequence like the chica role in anyway is going way off topic. Now, the chica you never had.
Speaker 3
What is that?
Craig
A chica roll. Baby.
Taylor
It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s kind of like.
Craig
For. It&rsquo;s a spring roll, but it&rsquo;s.
Taylor
Yeah, spring roll, but done in like a a more a more pastry.
Speaker 7
Yeah, it&rsquo;s.
Craig
Yeah. It&rsquo;s like a combination. Of a yeah, pasty and a spiral, yeah. Anyway, way off topic.
Taylor
No. Corn jacks are better, actually. They&rsquo;re filled with corn instead.
Craig
So that&rsquo;s a. Little start in terms of us starting to explore ideas of Orientalism today.
Taylor
Cyberpunk. Cyberpunk. Cyberpunk.
Craig
Yeah. We&rsquo;re gonna go into the techno Orientalism in coming weeks, so keep listening to.
Taylor
Ohh, we&rsquo;ve got. We&rsquo;ve got another. Comment. Comment. Yeah, not on the actual request line.
Craig
Oh, right, right. Yep. Thank you for that. Interesting. So the comment reads interesting to touch on the cyberpunk theme from the Western Japanese perspective. Ken. Yes, thank you, Ken. Exactly. So that I think is a really rich area where we can see storytelling happening at both ends, both the western view of Asia, particularly Japan in cyberpunk.
Speaker 7
Hmm.
Craig
And then later on we can see the reappropriation of that discourse in anime like Akira and Ghost in the Shell, which does something completely different with those same motifs of, you know, body modification through technology and the rise of Asian power in multinational companies. That&rsquo;s.
Taylor
Yep.
Craig
Alright. Yep. OK. So we&rsquo;re we&rsquo;re really at time now. Thanks for listening everyone. I hope you found that deep dive into the shadow. Interesting do listen to. The shadow. It&rsquo;s fascinating. Series then.
Taylor
Well, yeah, well, you know.
Craig
As the actors themselves said, I mean maybe falling to sleep to it, listen to you&rsquo;re going to fall asleep to you&rsquo;re on a long drive. There&rsquo;s some really quality storytelling, but you need to understand it&rsquo;s for audio. So there are those corny moments where they&rsquo;re over explaining the physicality of it. Like that scene where she&rsquo;s saying.
Speaker 11
Yeah.
Craig
Ohh, there&rsquo;s a snake coming out of the basket and you notice how the snake is moving side by side following the arms is so they&rsquo;re.
Taylor
They&rsquo;re they do it, they do it a lot more better in more modern things, so.
Phoebe
But.
Taylor
And. No. Yeah, like with Big Finish Doctor Who.
Craig
Story. Yes. Yeah, yeah. So the storytelling, you know, has has increasingly become more and more effective. Yes. All right. That&rsquo;s the medium mothership for another week. Thanks for listening. In next week, we&rsquo;ll jump into some more. Stuff. Thanks again for all those that are commenting. Taylor will decide how to deal with those comments as they come through.
Taylor
Punk. Ohh dear. So no, I&rsquo;m not going to respond to that. Probably not, yeah.
Craig
And I was like, listening next week, we&rsquo;re research, time permitting, we&rsquo;ll dive into techno Orientalism and cyber.
Taylor
Let me research, time permitting, I&rsquo;m 100% talking about it next.
Speaker 7
Time.
Craig
Week, OK, OK. There we go, guaranteed.
Taylor
Thanks. Yeah.
Craig
Name. Actually, this has been Craig Norris for another week, joined by. Taylor and Phoebe.
Taylor
Yeah, goodbye.
Craig
Thank you so much for joining us with your magical kalimba.

     Craig
You&rsquo;re listening to Edge Radio 99.3 FM. This is media mothership here broadcasting out of Edge Radio Studios in Nepal. Luna Hobart TAS.
Taylor
Hey, that sounds familiar.
Craig
We explore how media can shape our understanding of the world. Around us, we&rsquo;re streaming on edgeradio.org dot AU as well as on YouTube and Twitch. Yep, Yep. Just find us by searching media mothership. We&rsquo;re also on the DAB. Tab, The DAB system digital audio broadcasting system message in during today&rsquo;s show. Because it&rsquo;s an exciting, fantastic deep dive that we&rsquo;re doing so. So have this number ready 0488811707 to ask US questions with our special guest as we&rsquo;re doing the next.
Taylor
Oh yeah.
Craig
Now you can also send a message on the chat. On YouTube or? Twitch as always, I&rsquo;m your host Craig Norris, and we&rsquo;ll come back right after this tune. All right, welcome back. Special guest Edward Williams. Edward. Hello. Fantas, thank you for coming on and co-host Taylor. So Edward, you&rsquo;ve been really generous in terms of giving us the exclusive media release on this new project you&rsquo;ve set up. We&rsquo;ve had you on in the past with Big Love studios. Yes, this is Ulta like this. Well, you&rsquo;re a busy guy.
Edward
Yeah, no, this is completely different project separate from Daniel. It&rsquo;s mine.
Craig
The only thing. Yeah. So this is the launch. Well, you&rsquo;ve launched already, this is the part of the media tool you&rsquo;re doing promoting.
Edward
Yeah, yes, yeah.
Craig
Media tour media. Of your new tabletop role playing game, yes called Kingdoms of Amnesia.
Edward
Yes, yes. Well, yes.
Craig
Yep, Yep, Yep. So for those that don&rsquo;t know, what is table? Top role playing.
Edward
Games. Oh. You know. Many people have many different definitions of a tabletop role play, Gabe Craig, but my definition is it&rsquo;s basically. Collaborative role playing with the medium of a set of rules so. Without those rules, the, the, the the game element of it sort of isn&rsquo;t really there, and it&rsquo;s basically a marriage of the two role playing and gaming at the same time.
Craig
Yes.
Speaker
Yeah.
Craig
And people would know of Dungeons and Dragons, dungeons Dragons like. I mean, I guess you&rsquo;re talking about.
Edward
It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s dungeons and Dragons. Craig. Yeah. No, no, it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s. For for people who aren&rsquo;t aware of it, dungeons and Dragons is probably the best way and easiest way to. Sort of explain it to people.
Craig
But and you&rsquo;ll have, like a storyteller, a games master there. And then people will choose characters like someone will be an elf. Another person will be a dwarf, and then you&rsquo;ll have and the barbarian guy. Yeah. Yeah. And yeah, then you just kind of become murder hobos. Well, see.
Edward
See if they want. The rules are designed specifically to avoid the instances of murder hobos, murder hobos for those who don&rsquo;t know, are basically when you play a role playing game. In my opinion, often there&rsquo;s no stakes, so you just go around killing everyone you see in the game. In the game, in the.
Speaker
Hey.
Edward
Game in the game.
Craig
That&rsquo;s right. You go into a village and the games master might have set up a store for you to buy things off and suddenly the place is saying I just killed the storekeeper. And take all.
Edward
The things. Yeah, I mean that&rsquo;s an easy way of doing it.
Craig
So your game is is, is is very dense and we&rsquo;ve got our hands on the kind of players dungeon master Compedium. We&rsquo;ll show it up to.
Edward
The camera. Ohh yes, the the camera for those who are watching the stream and just listening.
Craig
There we go.
Speaker
Yeah.
Craig
This beautifully produced kingdoms of amnesia. Table top role playing game by Edward Williams. Now what sparked the initial idea for kingdoms of and was there something I said? You know, I need to create this.
Edward
World. Well, I&rsquo;ve always been a creative person, as you know, Craig. But. I started to try and make tabletop role playing games when I couldn&rsquo;t afford Dungeons and Dragons.
Speaker
So I couldn&rsquo;t.
Edward
Afford dungeons and Dragons or Pathfinder, so I decided to make a game. However the. I I didn&rsquo;t know what I was doing and say there was no systematic way about it and the mechanics came first and then the law sort of sprinkled its way in and filtered in. As I as I started to make it, as it started to become more solid as a game.
Craig
Right. So this has been in your mind. For a while.
Edward
Yes.
Craig
How long has it taken you to develop the game from that initial concept to this completion?
Edward
Let me just do the maths in my head. Play some music last year.
Speaker
No.
Edward
While you&rsquo;re waiting for this.
Taylor
It just I I just wanna say here I&rsquo;m glad that they found like decimal currency in the world cause 1 gold coin is worth 10 silver coins. Brilliant.
Craig
That&rsquo;s pretty.
Edward
Yeah. Yes. OK. So yeah, it is. It is decimalized and it does. Is the metric system because because it&rsquo;s not a traditional fantasy setting? Yeah, which I&rsquo;ll get into at a moment if you want. So let&rsquo;s see. How long has it been? It has been 14 years. Wow. Yeah, yeah.
Speaker
Excellent.
Craig
14 years. Great. Yeah. So this has really been percolating for for quite.
Edward
A while. Yeah. And look for those who&rsquo;ve you who have seen the book. It&rsquo;s only 50 pages, but those are 50 pages, which has been distilled down to the very, very best and refined and refined and refined and. I&rsquo;ve I&rsquo;ve started again about four or five times. I think it&rsquo;s four times. At one stage there was a version of the game that was 115 pages, but it was just so messy and. I think the length or the volume within the book isn&rsquo;t a reflection of the quality inside.
Craig
Right. OK. Well, we might.
Edward
As in, there&rsquo;s no correlation between the thickness and quality. Is what I meant to say.
Craig
Ah. It&rsquo;s still quite a hefty tone. OK, so let&rsquo;s go into the concept of this world that you&rsquo;re setting up. Histories being fractured and restarted, yes, which is really fascinating premise to start the world with what? Drew you to. Explore this theme of kind of lost memory and cyclical struggle well it.
Edward
It all started out as a thought experiment to see if I could create the perfect world, and then as I was creating this perfect world, I realised that hang on a second, I&rsquo;m starting to become a. Very. I&rsquo;m becoming a despot in this perfect. So it sort of made me really realise that. Wow. Even like, no matter how good your intentions are, you go, you always end up sort of going if only people just did what I said, then everything would be good. And then you realise, oh, hang on. I&rsquo;m being a bit of a. Bit of a dictator here so. It it it basically boils down to that thought experiment and then. Sort of stories kind of spin off from there. Hmm. And so they&rsquo;re, quote unquote, perfect world is actually an imperfect world because it&rsquo;s enforced by thought policing. And we&rsquo;re not thought policing more like Huxley&rsquo;s brave new world rather than a 1984.
Craig
Well, let&rsquo;s go into those 3. Central mythical characters that are in this, so you&rsquo;ve got the whale, the Leviathan and the minnow.
Edward
The minnow is a very minor. Character, sorry to.
Craig
Favourite.
Edward
OK, OK. So the the minnow, OK, so.
Craig
What&rsquo;s their relationship to?
Speaker
Yeah.
Edward
Each other, so the minnow is actually a very important character, just not very. The role of the minnow is sort of a a bit more of a secretive thing. At the moment I sort of want to kind of drip feed out the story and and so have the mystery kind of. Unwrap as people play the game as people get interested in it, even if people are just interested in the story and not necessarily the game. That&rsquo;s fine with me, but I will talk about the whale and what was the other one that.
Craig
So we&rsquo;ve got the whale, the violin.
Taylor
You know this? Yeah, well, no, no.
Edward
No, no. OK. So my interpretation of what the important characters are versus your interpretation of what the important.
Craig
All right, right. Right.
Speaker
OK, well. Because I guess because what we&rsquo;ve.
Craig
Got here is the settings. This is a post cataclysmic yes, well and and so history has been fractured and restarted. And then you&rsquo;ve got this deep lore involving powerful mythical entities. You&rsquo;ve got the whale, the Leviathan, the Mino and this complex social and political dynamics which is centred on the.
Edward
Yeah. Yes.
Craig
Enigmatic emperor yes, and ancient machines like the Colossus. Yes, right. So this, this detail. And then in the rule book you&rsquo;ve got the core rules and the advanced rules. Yes. Right. And so there&rsquo;s.
Speaker
Really.
Craig
Mechanics that cover everything from character creation, combat, magic, environment, social interaction. So I want to dig. Into some, yeah, yeah. Start with is this world building right? So these three central characters, what is the relationship between?
Edward
Yes. The these mythic entities. OK, so I&rsquo;ll start with the Leviathan. The Leviathan is the easiest 1. The Leviathan is basically ripped straight out of Thomas Hobbs. This philosopher economist.
Craig
Yep.
Edward
Political analysts from the 1700s, basically, his thick tone can boil down to basically government entities. Spiral out of control, no matter who&rsquo;s in charge, no matter how good the intentions are, they start to eat away at society, and society collapses in on itself because of the government. Sort of, yeah.
Craig
Sounds like like Bioshock, or it&rsquo;s the video game. It&rsquo;s a great premise, this one where, you know, utopic vision then.
Edward
And and that&rsquo;s the Leviathan. The Leviathan is an actual entity that starts off as, oh, I love this. So. So the the Leviathan starts off as a small serpent, much like the serpent in the Garden of Eden.
Speaker
Right.
Edward
You know Adam and Eve and then. So it it sort of digs its fangs. I guess you could call them into someone or a group of people. I&rsquo;m not going to say who, because that gives away too much of the mystery of of this story. And then it sort of grows into this Leviathan that basically swallows everything. In its path, yes, but it sort of collapses in under its own weight before that happens, and then it starts off as a small serpent again and sort of slowly builds up. And so it&rsquo;s a repeating cycle. So that&rsquo;s the Leviathan. That&rsquo;s the Leviathan and the whale. The whale is sort of more like. An innocent bystander in all of this, and that the source of all life comes from this whale.
Craig
And the whales kind of sacrifices itself.
Edward
It&rsquo;s sort of not necessarily sacrifice, it&rsquo;s sort of. Becomes catatonic and. Is in a state of shock after this apocalypse that happened hundreds of years ago.
Craig
Yeah, and that seems really central. To the theme of role playing games this kind of. You know the whale sacrifice is kind of a central aspect to.
Edward
Yeah. Well, it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s not a a, a voluntary sacrifice. It&rsquo;s a sacrifice that. Just comes about because of the amount of destruction it can&rsquo;t handle it. And it also represents wisdom being passed down through the ages, and because it&rsquo;s in a catatonic state. Yes, everyone forgets. Hence the name kingdoms of amnesia. So everyone forgets what actually. Happened in the past.
Craig
So like a fall of the Roman Empire, dark ages. Exactly. Yeah. Loss of that wisdom. And then you have the Renaissance. Yeah. Yeah, 800 years after.
Edward
Yeah. And the Mino the Mino is is. Representative of more. So yes, the whale does sacrifice itself, but it&rsquo;s an unwitting or involuntary sacrifice, whereas the minnow is a voluntary sacrifice and it&rsquo;s basically saying that it doesn&rsquo;t matter how small you think you are in this world. If you sacrifice yourself, then that is one of the biggest things you could do anyway so.
Craig
Like the final episode of school games, no spoilers, though.
Taylor
Hey I haven&rsquo;t watched it. I haven&rsquo;t.
Craig
Sacrifices pretty much wrapped. Into it I&rsquo;ve.
Edward
Only seen the first series to be honest. OK.
Craig
But you know, fortunately, here to promote good games.
Edward
Yes. Yeah, forget about this, minnow and this whale and Leviathan and the squid games.
Speaker
Why?
Craig
You want to talk about the Colossus, right? So without spoilers, if you could hint at what. The role of the ancient machine parties, right? The the Colossus in this world.
Edward
It&rsquo;s less of a philosophical and conceptual entity. It&rsquo;s more of a.
Craig
Leftover soldier, right? So it&rsquo;s been like it reminds me a bit of the some of Miyazaki&rsquo;s anime, the Laputa film, where you have those Colossus robots that are all kind of natures. Reclaim them in a way, but they they could get.
Taylor
That colossus thing, right? Hmm.
Edward
Reactivated and exactly. Yeah, it&rsquo;s more of a blank slate than the other 3.
Craig
So. Dense, fascinating world building within this the other thing that really struck me as I was reading through it was your philosophy towards being a game master. Yes. And at certain points you&rsquo;ll you&rsquo;ll address the reader about how you kind of feel games. Master could best approach. Unpacking all this and delivering content.
Edward
Yeah, and. That that&rsquo;s a section in the book that I had to think long and hard before actually putting it in because I I was thinking, what right do I have to tell people how to play the game? Because I do repeat somewhere in the book that it&rsquo;s their game, they can play it however they want. So really, who am I to say no? This is how it should be played then I thought. Margaret Gary, Guy, Gary Gary, Gary Gygax did it. And you know I&rsquo;m gonna do it, but mines more suggestions rather than prescriptions. I&rsquo;m not telling people what they have to do, just more sort of hey.
Speaker
I. It&rsquo;s great. Yeah, yeah. Look.
Edward
It might be a good idea to approach it this way, so some of the things that I say in there like you&rsquo;re not there to write a story, you&rsquo;re there to role play and for a lot of people that might come across as being a bit sort of well hang on, isn&rsquo;t the act of role playing collaboratively? Going to end up in a story. Yes it is, but if you&rsquo;re. If your intention is to create a story, then you then you go and create contrivances for your characters and sort of go Oh well. Well, it would make a better story if my character didn&rsquo;t do this, so I know that my character would do that, but I&rsquo;m going to make them do this, so we&rsquo;ve got a cool story to go along with it.
Craig
Because I like that distinction and emphasis you placed on game masters and the game master, of course, is the person who&rsquo;s directed the action. They&rsquo;re the ones who will set up, you know, so you&rsquo;re in a wilderness, you&rsquo;re coming to a Tavern.
Edward
The the the game master is in my opinion and again everyone. This is my opinion. You can have differing opinions and but this is. This is mine. This is mine. Damn it. Sorry, sorry. Getting a bit angry there. So my in my opinion, the game master is there to create the environment with which the other players interact with the world. And it&rsquo;s difficult to sort of.
Speaker
OK, you&rsquo;ve done that.
Edward
Because on one hand you go well, the game master generally puts a heck of a lot more effort in than the players they&rsquo;re putting on putting in a lot of effort into the scenarios, into the locations and the NPCS non player characters. But. That should be done willingly and it should be a a not a burden, but something that they do out of joy and passion and love for their players. You know, and I&rsquo;m very big on on this sort of. Showing love to people and and yes, you know. Love might be a bit of a strong word, but it&rsquo;s the word. I like to use.
Craig
Because you do make that point that the game masters should see themselves as facilitators rather than storytellers controlling the narrative. And it&rsquo;s a very strong stance to take and. I was kind of curious if there was a. A kind of personal experience that led. You to that. Was there a game experience that you&rsquo;ve had where that it did go well? Is there an experience? That led you to that philosophy.
Edward
Yes, Craig, there is.
Craig
OK. Is it child friendly? Do we need to? Make a language warning.
Edward
No, no, no, no, this is this is. Child friendly basically. I I&rsquo;ve gone into games blind where GM&rsquo;s. Sort of. They have this mentality of no, no, this is what we&rsquo;re doing. You will. You will do this. And this is the role you play within that. And if you deviate from that role, then you know you&rsquo;re not playing it properly. And I&rsquo;m just sort of thinking. What this is this is insane. I&rsquo;m here to enjoy myself. And. And you&rsquo;re here to enjoy yourself. And if in order for you to enjoy yourself, you have to sort of. Shackle. Your fellow playmates. That&rsquo;s kind of it just rubs me the wrong way.
Craig
Yeah. So rather than facilitating a direction that might not be the initial plan.
Edward
Yeah.
Craig
That you&rsquo;re asked to have.
Edward
And This is why I say role play, not storytelling. Because if you&rsquo;re telling a story, then the GM in their mind goes no, no, no. You&rsquo;re supposed to be doing this. You know, you need to follow the story because if you&rsquo;re not doing this, you&rsquo;re not following the story. You&rsquo;re not playing my game. And yeah. And I&rsquo;ve also had gems where it&rsquo;s like, OK, we&rsquo;re going to break for lunch. Now back in 15 minutes, I&rsquo;m thinking. Is this is this a? Is this a? Am I at work? Is this a? Is this a? Is this a 15 minute? You know, break from my my job, you know, so a lot of the experiences I have had. Have been very much. That and and then the GMs also hold it over the other players that they&rsquo;ve put in all this effort, they&rsquo;ve paid all this money for all these books and all this stuff and I&rsquo;m thinking. Yes, you have, but that doesn&rsquo;t give you the right to dictate to me. The the terms of of of this session you.
Craig
Know. Yeah. Yeah, there there should be and. And because I guess if you if the gym isn&rsquo;t going to listen, yeah, what is your recourse to just leave or to?
Edward
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Look, I&rsquo;ve I I think it&rsquo;s best to just leave, give them a chance or two. In the past, I haven&rsquo;t done that, but that&rsquo;s something in circumstances where the gym has been a real. Like you know, this is this is. You you are. You are here to roll dice. You&rsquo;re not here to make decisions. And. And that&rsquo;s where I go. Yeah, I&rsquo;ve been lied to. I&rsquo;m not going to play. And I just leave.
Craig
Because I guess, yeah, I mean it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s tricky, isn&rsquo;t it? It&rsquo;s a new if you&rsquo;re a new GM in particular to shift that mode of thinking from feeling, you need to control the story. To being able to embrace player agents.
Edward
Yeah. And honestly, there is no right answer. That&rsquo;s just my opinion. The the reality is, is that that there&rsquo;s hours upon our hundreds, thousands, probably millions of hours of YouTube videos and millions of articles of people discussing this very topic and. There&rsquo;s no consensus and so.
Craig
I guess it&rsquo;s very context specific.
Edward
Exactly. And you know you. There might be a situation where one of your players has a bit of anxiety around making decisions.
Craig
Yeah.
Edward
And they may need a little bit of. Additional support in that and that inevitably results in you taking away some of their agency, which if that&rsquo;s how you want to deal with it, if that&rsquo;s what makes you both comfortable, then that makes you both comfortable. And so I&rsquo;m not here to tell people what to do. I&rsquo;m just saying my thoughts on it. So it even says my thoughts on being a GM, it doesn&rsquo;t say. Yes, it doesn&rsquo;t say. This is how you have to play the game. Oh, yeah. My thoughts on TTR RPG. So tabletop role playing game there we.
Craig
Go. It is mapped out. I mean in there. You do write. Specifically of these consequences being real and unavoidable, and the other examples. That you&rsquo;ve encountered.
Edward
Yeah, but they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re a bit too. Close.
Craig
Because it&rsquo;s very emotional. I mean, I guess, yeah, there&rsquo;s in these spaces, it can be you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re having to be vulnerable.
Edward
Ohh you can. Yeah, you can easily destroy friendships if you don&rsquo;t handle. It properly, yeah.
Speaker
Like.
Edward
It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s not. You know. But yeah, I guess, yeah, it it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s difficult because it&rsquo;s just a game. But but, but you could really screw up friendships if you don&rsquo;t approach it.
Craig
Yes.
Edward
You know, in a A a way that is. Wholesome for everyone.
Craig
And I found that this on page two of the manual to be really important. You know that you mapped it out again. I appreciate the. The difficulty of starting that conversation and but I. But you know, as we&rsquo;re mapping out here, I think it&rsquo;s so important. A lot of people forget that step of laying some ground rules or some expectations or just. During what each other expects, their roles will be in the space and before you know it, it&rsquo;s gone too far down and and you&rsquo;ve potentially broken something either the game. Or a friendship.
Edward
Yeah.
Craig
So, because equally you know there&rsquo;s more positive stories that come out of these environments of role playing games than negatives. Fortunately, it can be. A great space. To develop and enrich friendships.
Edward
Ohh. Ohh yeah 100. Sent. You know you can help grow your friendships, you can help your problem solving and your communication skills and your maths. You can. You can expand all sorts of things through role playing. But. Some, sometimes. You can. Have a negative experience and when you have negative experience after negative experience after negative experience you&rsquo;re so gotta ask yourself what&rsquo;s the common denominator? Yes, you know why.
Craig
Is it me?
Edward
Yeah. Is it me you know? And, you know, reality is, it could be me. I could be the.
Craig
Problem. Yeah. Or it could be a particularly toxic environment, yeah.
Edward
Yeah, I mean I I I I had the arrogance to create my own tabletop role playing game because because nobody was playing the way I. Wanted to play.
Speaker 1
That&rsquo;s it.
Craig
I mean, I think that&rsquo;s fantastic. Moving it from, you know, thought to practise now. You mentioned maths, so I want to talk a bit about the mechanics and some of the design decisions design decision made. So you&rsquo;ve chosen the D100 and to the classic D20. Why the D100?
Speaker
Hmm.
Edward
Good question, Craig. I&rsquo;ve wrestled long and hard for 14 years to come up with the answer. Well, 13 years at the time of this, this show, this radio show, so it it initially was.
Speaker
Yeah.
Edward
Oh gosh, this is going back like 14 years. So the initial thing was there would be, I think 6 stats, fairly generic stats. And for every point in that stat, you&rsquo;ve got 1D6, so I&rsquo;m going to use terms that may may not make sense to some people, so I&rsquo;m just going to explain that one D6 is a six sided dice. Or die. So. That was cool because you got to roll a lot of dice because a lot, you know, a lot of the fun is rolling a lot of dice.
Craig
As long as the numbers are good.
Edward
Yeah, but the game was so unbalanced, which for for a tabletop role playing game balance isn&rsquo;t necessarily the most important thing. Yeah, but it was so, so unbalanced that I thought, oh, because, you know, you&rsquo;d have someone with two and a stat.
Craig
Yeah.
Edward
And someone with five in a stat and you&rsquo;d be rolling 2 dice and they&rsquo;d be rolling 5 and you go well. Well, this isn&rsquo;t fun, you know.
Speaker
Yes.
Edward
So it went from that to 2D6 because I thought, oh, Bell curve, everyone likes the bell curve. You know anything to avoid a day 20? Because I because I don&rsquo;t like the lottery aspect of it. The sort of what numbers gonna come up, you know, and. And I know, I know for a lot of people that is actually part of the appeal that is the draw. But for me that&rsquo;s not really compelling game.
Craig
Particularly yes, if you if you constantly. The crap out on those roles? Yeah, it it can seem punishing in terms of it&rsquo;s not anything I&rsquo;m doing in terms of my decision making. It&rsquo;s just bad luck with these damn dice roles, and that can quickly get old fast. Yeah.
Edward
Yeah.
Craig
So you&rsquo;ve gone for D1.
Edward
100 since AD 100 system and the reason I&rsquo;ve gone for a D100 system is because the stats the stats make me go for a day 100 system. So in kingdoms of amnesia, unlike a lot of, well, a lot of more like.
Craig
Say it.
Edward
Unlike Dungeons and Dragons.
Taylor
Sure.
Craig
Should be a bingo card. That we&rsquo;re going to.
Edward
Use. Unlike dungeons or Dragons, or and Dragons, unlike Dungeons and Dungeons and Dragons and Dragons. What am I saying?
Craig
We&rsquo;re giving a lot of promotion for the.
Edward
Messages coming. Kingdoms of amnesia. No. So unlike. Games of that ilk. What is the point I&rsquo;m. Trying to make Ohh hold on well.
Craig
Let&rsquo;s go to the messages, yeah. We have Nathan, can you read that? From where you are. Not really. OK. We have Nathan Sylvester Taylor. We miss you. And what&rsquo;s the topic today? OK. Well, just to remind people tuning in Edge Radio 99.3 FM, we&rsquo;re talking with game designer.
Taylor
Just just reminding my stalker, yeah.
Craig
Edward Williams about his latest new game, Kingdoms of Amnesia, which you can see on the live stream now. And this is a tabletop role playing game. It&rsquo;s a local game created here, and where can people find this if they&rsquo;re wanting to dig into it while we&rsquo;re talking about it?
Edward
Ah. That is a good question. So so I&rsquo;ve been. I&rsquo;m good at the creating side. I&rsquo;m not very good at the distributing side.
Taylor
Distributed.
Edward
So there is a place called SB Games, SB games, not EB games. SB Games on Elizabeth St they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re being sold there. I&rsquo;m sort of testing the waters with Area 52, and I will eventually get around to talking to.
Craig
OK. All right.
Edward
Ohh Mona. Good games. Ohh good games, good games. No. Is that it? Yeah. Good games. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, my goodness. Sorry. Sorry. Good games.
Craig
Ohh great. That&rsquo;s great, friend of the. Show, yeah.
Edward
So good games is on Brisbane St there I I saved it so OK, so the reason. That have gone with AD 100 system and the reason that the stats are the way that they are. So there&rsquo;s 20. Oh gosh, 21 stats or 22 stats, I forget. And is because it&rsquo;s a. It&rsquo;s more stats based than abilities based, so in the game the other game you you choose abilities and you get more abilities and that allows you to do more things in a different way, whereas mine is just more sort of well, everyone can swim. It just depends on how competently that can. Right. Yeah. So that I mean, having said that, there are abilities in, in the game, otherwise it would be pretty there&rsquo;d be no real flavour to the mechanics. And and that&rsquo;s why day 100 to give people that room to put, Yep, more and more points into those stats.
Craig
So I mean, you also have core rules and advanced rules. How how would you suggest players approach?
Edward
That. OK, well, Craig. So there&rsquo;s actually call rules, advanced rules and additional.
Craig
Rules, OK. Yeah.
Edward
Yeah. So additional rules are rules. OK now. There is a reason, so the core rules are you you really need to know these rules in order to play effectively. Otherwise you&rsquo;re going to have to constantly ask someone sitting next to you. How do I? How do I do this?
Craig
And to get my health going.
Edward
Yeah. And so that&rsquo;s only 1 1/2 pages. Or something I don&rsquo;t know I. Can&rsquo;t remember it is.
Craig
22 pages 2 and a.
Edward
Half Pages, 2 1/2 pages I I know the game backwards and frontwards like the the front of my hand kingdoms of amnesia. That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re talking about. OK. Yeah, so.
Speaker
That&rsquo;s right.
Craig
The additional rules is 1 and.
Edward
1/2 yes, that&rsquo;s it. So. The core rules are sort of. I hate using the word mandatory in order to play the game. You need to know the core rules in order to play the game. The additional rules are also rules that. You need to know, but if you&rsquo;re not. Going to use them. Then you don&rsquo;t need to know them. So like if you don&rsquo;t plan on sneak attack grappling someone, for example, that&rsquo;s an additional rules you don&rsquo;t need to know it, you just need to know that that is a possibility. Advanced rules are sort of. When you want to add like. Customizations. To the guys.
Craig
Right.
Edward
Yeah, of course I do endorse home brewing. Home brewing is always.
Craig
Good. And that&rsquo;s where you kind of. Set up house rules. Or you want to put some cyberpunk stuff in there or.
Edward
Yeah, yeah, exactly. Because I understand that I&rsquo;m not. I&rsquo;m not going to be able to cover everything. For every, I&rsquo;m not going to be able to be everything to everyone. So I&rsquo;m just making the game that I enjoy. That&rsquo;s fantastic. Does that answer? Your question, yes, yes.
Craig
Next. Kind of system I&rsquo;m going to talk about is the magic system. Yes. OK. So in the magic system, you&rsquo;ve got magic and manner stats, yes. So why did you split the magic system into having manner and magic?
Edward
So your manner is your capacity. To perform magic. And your magic is your ability to perform magic.
Craig
So it&rsquo;s a manner like the.
Edward
Like you&rsquo;ll. You&rsquo;ll exhaust it. No. Renew it? No. So there&rsquo;s no real resource management when it comes to magic in this game, which I know for a lot of people, resource management is a part of the.
Craig
And you want. Appeal because resource management is where you&rsquo;ll need to collect. Of gems or have enough of something, and then you&rsquo;ll expand it and then you need to find some more to renew it, or you&rsquo;ll need to rest for a day or something like that. That kind of renews.
Edward
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. And that does add limitations to the game. I appreciate that and. But you know, if you want to have things that deplete, if you want your manner to deplete. Then. You could make it deplete. It doesn&rsquo;t bother me. It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s your game.
Craig
So remind me again so. What? What are the two systems so? That the magic manner are.
Edward
Yes, so. Yeah, so manner is your your capacity. So the more powerful spells require more manner. Yeah. And your magic is your ability to actually cast it. So you might have say 100 manner and 40 magic and you try to cast this, this fireball, this massive fireball. And you can, theoretically you can. But. Your chances of actually pulling it off successfully are greatly diminished.
Craig
Rightly. Yeah, because you&rsquo;re only sitting on a 40 magic score. Yeah, but your manners up at 100, which is a large.
Edward
Number Yep. And you&rsquo;re trying to cast a spell that requires 100 manner.
Craig
Yeah, right. Yeah. Because it is. Yeah. It&rsquo;s one of those things we are trying to solve a problem as you&rsquo;re getting the. Mechanics setup. Yeah, that&rsquo;s addressing a very real world thing. If you if you you need to scale up, you need to cultivate and develop. Yeah. Alright. So the next system I want to talk about. If there&rsquo;s nothing further the magic system. Any questions about magic? Harry Potter universe play.
Taylor
What?
Craig
Can you do? Experiences.
Edward
You can, with disarming someone physically, yes. That&rsquo;s still the Expelliarmus doesn&rsquo;t. Yeah, yeah.
Craig
All that Harry Potter does throughout the series, that&rsquo;s his one spell, yeah.
Edward
Cruise. No, no, that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s the bad guys. He does Patronus at one stage, yeah, yeah.
Craig
All right. OK, skipping on.
Speaker
Well.
Edward
No, I think I&rsquo;ll, I&rsquo;ll just, sorry to sorry to, but with with the magic, it&rsquo;s more conceptual than so there&rsquo;s no like Fireball. It&rsquo;s just sort of this spell does damage.
Speaker
Yes, please, please.
Edward
It&rsquo;s up to you if you if it&rsquo;s up to you if.
Speaker
Really, right.
Edward
You think?
Taylor
It has an element or something.
Edward
It&rsquo;s a fireball. Yeah, like, it&rsquo;s up to you. If it&rsquo;s a fireball or a or, you know, just a magical entity or whatever. Like. So it means that I could strip down the magic and make it like 5 or 6 pages. And you just sort of play around with the rules within the magic system.
Speaker
Right. Yes.
Craig
So you can role play into the magic. Yeah, yeah. Experience. But in terms of crude numbers, there&rsquo;s damage. And that&rsquo;s what matters. Yeah. It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s damage point that you&rsquo;re rolling. Yeah. Yeah. And.
Edward
You know, admittedly it might. You could be considered lazy because, well, because you know, like, I could go, oh, well, there&rsquo;s a magic missile. And that&rsquo;s just raw damage. And then there is a fireball and that does fire damage, which does this additional thing area damage all that sort of stuff.
Speaker
Yes. An area.
Taylor
Hmm.
Edward
But that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s the way it I&rsquo;ve done it because I want people to focus more on, you know.
Speaker
Hmm.
Edward
Trying to play around with their with the spell. Yeah, you know, manipulate it in a way that works for their character or solves the problem in front of them. Sorry to.
Craig
Yes. No, I think that&rsquo;s really revealing. I like. That because the other system I wanted. To talk about was the opinion system. For. Social interactions. So at the moment, you&rsquo;ve or in the in the game, you&rsquo;ve got a range from a door to height, yes. And I think that&rsquo;s really interesting. So how do you reckon that&rsquo;s going to affect or have you seen it affect the role playing at the?
Speaker
Well. Well.
Edward
So this is one of the things. So there are several mechanics that I&rsquo;ve made to try and prevent murder hobos. This is this is the main thing. Yes, because it&rsquo;s sort of well, if you could be a murder hobo. But then everyone in town hates you. So they&rsquo;re not really going to be able to, they&rsquo;re not really going to answer your questions as readily. They&rsquo;re not going to be as easily persuaded by you or or whatever, you know. So if you need information out of someone. You they&rsquo;re not just going to say, oh, yeah, sure. I&rsquo;ll give it to you because they&rsquo;ve they&rsquo;ve seen.
Craig
It because you&rsquo;ve got that social interaction score.
Edward
Of hate. Yeah. And it&rsquo;s that sort of. That scales to whatever the GM sort of decides like if they decide that&rsquo;s an entire country that hates you, or just that town, or just that one person or that Guild. Yeah. Or, you know, whatever.
Craig
All right. Hmm. Message through from strategic. Well, thank you very much for welcoming back. It&rsquo;s good to be back and it&rsquo;s great to have a great show with Edward Williams talking about his new tabletop role playing game that he&rsquo;s just developed kingdoms of amnesia available locally in Hobart. Will it be available overseason into state? You got an Amazon deal.
Edward
No, no, so OK. So unfortunately I decided to make this in a four. Right. Which limits it to.
Craig
Because you can print on demand, right if.
Edward
You. Yes. So if I want to distribute it globally, I can do it in its current form, but it would cost a lot more and I&rsquo;d have to deal with import export nonsense. Or I could reformat it onto size that can be size.
Speaker
OK.
Craig
Whatever your.
Edward
Whatever is globally distributable, yeah, yes, there is a plan eventually to get to that stage, but I want to focus on Tasmania and.
Craig
Yeah.
Edward
Yeah, I want to focus on Tasmania and then maybe. There there are parts of Europe which, because I&rsquo;ve got friends in Europe and England, I can sort of give them a few copies to sort of spread the good word.
Craig
At the moment it&rsquo;s only available in print, not electronic form yet.
Edward
Correct, because I haven&rsquo;t. I haven&rsquo;t. I I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m doing, Craig.
Speaker
Like.
Edward
I&rsquo;m solving one problem at a time and I&rsquo;m trying to do it correctly and I I don&rsquo;t know the best way to go about.
Craig
It to be honest, I I think it&rsquo;s coming along really. Really. Well, so I just. Got to turn my.
Edward
My real focus is. To support the people who already have a copy and really sort of help them understand the game, and if they&rsquo;ve got questions, they can ask me. Speaking of which, yes, there is an email for kingdoms of amnesia. No, not in the book. I&rsquo;m sorry guys.
Taylor
Oh.
Edward
Look, I can&rsquo;t think of everything, despite what you may think. So. The email is nocapitalskingdomsofamnesia@gmail.com right kingdomsofamnesia@gmail.com it&rsquo;s that if you&rsquo;ve got any questions about the game or if you&rsquo;re Interstate and you&rsquo;ll want a copy and we can talk about, we can discuss how to get a copy to you. So.
Craig
There we go. Yes, because I think that just got.
Speaker
Awesome.
Craig
Based on our chats from.
Edward
What about the rest of the nation? Well, the rest of the nation.
Craig
Big boy.
Edward
Look. Sydney is a big place. I I don&rsquo;t know where to start. I don&rsquo;t know where to start in Melbourne. I don&rsquo;t know where to start in Brisbane, Adelaide because the The thing is, is that I&rsquo;ve already got these relationships with these game store owners and like I know their name, they know my name. And we can build off that. Trying to approach stores in the rest of the nation is pretty overwhelming to me at the moment, and until I&rsquo;ve got a product that I can say, hey, look, it&rsquo;s really popular in Tasmania. They&rsquo;re not really going to be interested in it, but to individuals that want to reach out to me, then there is that email yeskingdomsofamnesia@gmail.com.
Craig
Well, we&rsquo;ll put those contact details up in the. Show notes so.
Taylor
Can I just ask a bit of a few questions about how you sort of like set it out? Like what sort of software did you use to create?
Edward
This just word just a word processor warehouse.
Craig
Really just Microsoft Word. Yeah or equivalent.
Edward
Ohh well well. A free equivalent, yeah.
Speaker
Yeah.
Craig
Leave our office.
Edward
Or WPS office. Yeah, so.
Taylor
Oh, OK, OK.
Edward
The Yeah, the the only thing that I regret is that because I. Well, these just make it special copies, so this copy, as you can see the border isn&rsquo;t. Equidistant from the top and the sides, it was designed to be shrunk down slightly to actually fit on the page. Yeah, which I had done, but then I added an extra 2 pages and so I had to redo the cover. Yeah, and I forgot to resize the front.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
Right.
Speaker
Yeah.
Taylor
Because I was noticing that cause, there&rsquo;s quite a big border around these ones, yeah.
Edward
Yeah. Yes.
Craig
Yeah. Who is on the cover? Who is that?
Edward
A picture of that is the emperor.
Craig
Really. Yes. Right. Who&rsquo;s?
Taylor
So when it when it says like inside cover concept by Edward Williams cover concept, does that mean produce who they are?
Edward
No, no.
Speaker
This is.
Craig
An important.
Taylor
Yeah, exactly. Yeah.
Craig
Moral question, Mark, he says. Isn&rsquo;t it? I.
Edward
Mean I I believe in supporting artists and I believe in paying them what they ask plus more if you can afford it. So this without getting into too many details because you know I don&rsquo;t want to. You know. So. I went to fiver. OK, yeah, and got the artwork commissioned. And so I basically told this person this is what I want. And here&rsquo;s a here&rsquo;s a picture of something that kind of isn&rsquo;t inspiration for it. Beyond that, do what you want. So.
Speaker 1
Yeah.
Edward
I I I. Came up with the concept, but I didn&rsquo;t actually draw it. An artist on five it did. Now I asked explicitly if they wanted to be credited. They they basically said no, which I think OK, fair enough. If they don&rsquo;t want to be credited, then you know. 25% tip, you know. Yeah. You know, just like like, because I I also wanna I wanna remain friends with this artist because I wanna get them to do things in the.
Speaker
Yeah.
Taylor
More, yeah.
Edward
Future. So well, it&rsquo;s. Great artwork. Ohh, it&rsquo;s fantastic. It&rsquo;s really I I I think it&rsquo;s.
Speaker
Yeah.
Edward
I think it&rsquo;s really wonderful.
Speaker
Hmm.
Craig
Yeah, yeah, no, look, it has that kind of haunted. Sunken face and he&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s a well, actually I was going to start going into characters and we&rsquo;ve got about 5 minutes left. No, we have to get you back. But do you have any favourite or unusual characters that have been created within this system? Because it&rsquo;s quite a detailed character creation system you&rsquo;ve set up. In the game well.
Edward
Not really. I just sort of. What happens happens like I I don&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m not really. No, no.
Craig
No. You play test it, you play. Tested it with friends and family.
Edward
Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, not family. They wouldn&rsquo;t be interesting.
Craig
What are what are the? Types of characters that and merge in this game, like we&rsquo;re talking dwarfs and elves, yeah.
Edward
Just people like like like cause the other game. Which for those, for those of you who have listed you, probably you probably know what game I&rsquo;m talking about. That&rsquo;s sort of it&rsquo;s centred around heroes. You know, you become heroes and you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re whereas mine sort of.
Craig
We do not.
Speaker
Baltimore.
Edward
More. Explorers and people trying to. Explore and discover the secrets of the world, or. Whatever their motivations are, and so the character design or the character creation is designed to create basically your average person and then over the course of your adventures you you increase in skill.
Craig
Because we&rsquo;re running a little bit of time left. I do know you&rsquo;ve got ambitious plans to explore further aspects. Of this world. Yes, right, Haven temples of the ancient world, the Necromancer. Which one are you the most excited to jump into and start fleshing out?
Edward
Well, that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s a bit of a loaded question because what I&rsquo;m most excited for and what I can actually achieve is different. So the Necromancer is the one that I&rsquo;m doing at the moment. Basically getting someone to write the story for that one because. I&rsquo;m more of a large concept in the broader law of the of the world, but I think that if I&rsquo;m writing everything. And I&rsquo;m not good with names. So, so, you know, it&rsquo;s not going to come up with. It&rsquo;s not going to create compelling names. So if I commissioned someone else to do it and say, here&rsquo;s the kind of story I want you to. Write. Then, then there&rsquo;s more compelling names and a more. Diverse spectrum of opinions and views and inputs into the world. So the Necromancer is the one that&rsquo;s being done at the moment. That&rsquo;s the easiest one. Not to say that it&rsquo;s bad, it&rsquo;s just easier to get it done. Haven is probably the most difficult because that is that&rsquo;s going to explore a place that has many, many more answers. To the. Ancient past than any other story, but. It requires a lot more time and a lot more thought to put into it to actually get done.
Speaker
Hmm.
Craig
All right, well. Sadly, we&rsquo;ll we&rsquo;ll need to start wrapping up. So we&rsquo;ve already said a little bit about where people can find the game and connect with the community. This, of course, is kingdoms of amnesia. The table top role playing game by Edward Williams. Are you setting up any community for this game? It&rsquo;s going to be like a discord or a Facebook.
Edward
I&rsquo;m not sorry.
Craig
Well, the fans, you know the. Fans.
Edward
Do it. I&rsquo;m. I&rsquo;m not so good at these things, Craig. Look, maybe a discord.
Speaker
I.
Edward
I I I want I want it to be I I don&rsquo;t know what I want it to be. I don&rsquo;t know how to manage it. I don&rsquo;t know how to build it. All I know is that I just want to show people and if they get excited about doing it and they. You know, get involved. Then they can do that. And I&rsquo;m more than happy for people to sort of. Take on board or take it on board and and fly away with it. That&rsquo;s fine. I mean, it&rsquo;s my game that I made, but. But you know, it&rsquo;s also their game that they can play kind of thing.
Craig
Wonderful. Well, we will put any details you&rsquo;d like to share with us on the show notes. We have one. Yeah. Thank you very. Much for big boy. Natalie, I need to move my glasses. Great stream, as always. See you next week. Yes, so we will be back next week with a new topic, but we will post show notes up about kingdoms of amnesia, the tabletop role playing game by Edward Williams Up on podcast. As well as on the YouTube. And Instagram. If people do want to reach out to you, they. Can grab you on.
Edward
The email that email kingdomsofamnesia@gmail.com I&rsquo;m I&rsquo;m pretty accessible in other ways like sorry.
Taylor
OK, what&rsquo;s your address? OK, what&rsquo;s?
Edward
Your address. No, no, no. No. No, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, like. Like I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;m sure. People, especially in Hobart, would be able to track me down, yeah. Like it&rsquo;s easier for me to compile like all the information on email. I&rsquo;m a simple man, you know. Emails, emails, the way to go for me. If people want to make a discord, OK? Yeah.
Craig
Well, you know. That&rsquo;s always my hope with our fans.
Taylor
What happened?
Speaker
But.
Craig
In the future? Well, William, thanks very much for calling Ed Wood. I think that. Was one of the. Edward Williams was just Mr. Williams.
Taylor
How many times have you had him?
Craig
On the show, Edward Williams.
Edward
Norris. Benston, Norris, Norris, Winston.
Craig
Well, you know, it&rsquo;s the way they know when they are. Look at the streams. I mean, there&rsquo;s no AI happening on that stream. Who knows what a IMS is happening on the street? Anyway, thanks for listening to Edge Radio and Media mothership for another week. We&rsquo;ll be back next week with some new exciting stuff on kingdoms of amnesia and any other.
Taylor
What is happening there actually, yeah.
Edward
Very fitting, very. Kingdoms of major.
Speaker
Yeah.
Edward
Ohh. We paused to get alright.
Craig
Anyway, keep listening now to Edge radio for some really cool music and thanks again Taylor and Edward coming along.
Edward

Taylor
Bye.

<p>Why the renewed interest in &ldquo;Star Wars: Battlefront 2&rdquo;? What are the ambitious plans from Chinese studios to AI-remake classic kung fu films featuring legends like Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan, and Jet Li. Plus, why the urgency to recover Marty McFly&rsquo;s lost guitar from &ldquo;Back to the Future&rdquo;?<br>We also take a deep dive into Stephen King&rsquo;s &lsquo;interior eye&rsquo; from &ldquo;Danse Macabre,&rdquo; tracing its roots back to Stan Freberg&rsquo;s iconic radio sketch, &ldquo;Anybody Here Remember Radio?&rdquo; Was TV truly a disruptive force for radio? Tune in as we tackle the fears of the 1960s and 1980s, as both Freberg and King weigh in on the impact of radio dramas.</p>

<p>Using Blake Snyder&rsquo;s (2005) framework from <em>Save the Cat</em>, along with media theories from Slavoj &#381;i&#382;ek and Stuart Hall, we will uncover the compelling story structure and the unstoppable horror tropes it embodies. We will also examine its cultural impact through insights from Stephen King&rsquo;s analysis of radio horror and Bill Cosby&rsquo;s comedic retelling.</p>

      Craig
Alright, welcome here to media mothership here on Edge Radio 99.3 FM.
Speaker 3
What made half life, Alex there we.
Speaker
OK. Yeah.
Craig
Go. Yes. Alright. So as always, we&rsquo;re using the wonderful technology from Edge Radio studios here at Nepal, Luna, Hobart TAS. And I&rsquo;m your host, Craig. On this show, we explore how media can cheap our understanding of the world around us. Last week we took a deep dive into various parts of pop culture, including some and. Or Star Wars? Stuff and a little bit of discussion of anime as well as some news and current pop culture topics. Today&rsquo;s topic we&rsquo;re going to do a huge deep dive into. Horror and radio. I came across some really fascinating discussion from Stephen King in his book dance Macabre, talking about the impact of radio, effectively conveying horror. So we&rsquo;re going to listen to a classic short 7 minute. Horror. Drama called Chicken Hearts Chicken Heart the most unlikely of things that could drive horror into the heart of a listener. So we listen to that. Some people might also know of chicken heart from the fantastic, though now problematic Bill Cosby sketch that he did in one of his early live up. Live stand up albums we&rsquo;ll we&rsquo;ll. Unpack all of that. That and a whole bunch of other stuff on media mothership today, but the main question is, you know, this, this, this idea of how it has seven minute radio drama from 1937 can still I, I reckon haunt pop culture today. I reckon there&rsquo;s some. Lessons and some interesting. Political reverberations that chicken hearts. Echoes with today&rsquo;s politics, particularly the news we&rsquo;re hearing out of California and the kind of. Trump military police crackdown that&rsquo;s going on there I. Think there&rsquo;s chicken heart? Is in conversation with even scary politics like that today. So keep listening to. Media mothership with myself Craig here on Edge Radio, 99.3 FM. Of course. If you do have any comments while we&rsquo;re doing today, show you can SMS US directly in the studio on 0488811707 or reach out to us via the live stream. On YouTube and Twitch. OK, welcome back now. Musical accompaniment, the thumb, Hogan. Chicken hearts. So I guess to set up this idea of how a 7 minute radio drama from way back in 1937 still packs a punch. Or does it?
Speaker
We&rsquo;ll, we&rsquo;ll, we&rsquo;ll.
Craig
Look a little bit about the history first of it, why this kind of? Matters so chicken Hearts broadcast 1937. It&rsquo;s written by one of the big names in radio dramas, particular horror Arch Oboler, and he wrote for the radio drama series mainly lights out. We&rsquo;ll listen to the Bill Cosby sketch, which kind of amps up the experience of watching. Or sorry, of listening to radio dramas like Light Sounds briefly before we dive into listening to it, the the story of Chicken Heart is is basically a scientific experiment which goes horribly wrong. You know, it starts with this idea of a checking. And then as we&rsquo;ll hear. Things escalate into this crazy panic. To put it in a little bit of context, I guess you got to understand that at the time this was written in the 1930s, you&rsquo;ve got this really cool, fascinating glimpse into some of the I reckon the key anxieties. That were echoing or that were occurring in that time in the late 30s. Think about it. I mean, here we are pretty much in the Golden Age of radio in the 30s. You know, television has certainly not. Made an impact, right? You you really needing to earn to the 50s and 60s? Nineteen 30S was still dominated by radio. Radio was the form of of popular entertainment and communication and a series like lights, Lights out. And this is one of the early episodes. From it is part of what was making radio drama something so exciting for people to listen into. Now, importantly, some of you. Guys might have. Heard of the classic media panic radio drama that was Orson Welles? War of the world? That was the one, of course, that led to a huge panic around the power of media and radio to again shape the way people perceived reality around them. You know, war of the worlds based on HD World&rsquo;s Classic novel was broadcast in radio, formed by Orson Welles and done in such a manner. That people thought the live broadcast that was occurring was actually happening. And again it did that by echoing some of the broadcasts that were happening at that point from the. Blitz that was occurring on England during World War Two from the German air bombings and evoking that sense of disaster, the Hindenburg disaster, which was broadcast on radio. So again this. Chicken heart occurs one year, so it&rsquo;s broadcast to one year before war of the Worlds, but I think it sets up the same type of media panic and certainly Bill Cosby&rsquo;s comedy sketch about his experience listening to Chicken Heart is all about. The media panic he experienced listening to chicken heart. So we&rsquo;ll play a little bit of that Bill Cosby thing as well as the Stephen King analysis of Chicken Heart shortly. But before we go any further, the other thing to listen out for I guess is this idea that in the 1930s you got to see this movement of of kind of science and medicine. That&rsquo;s going through incredibly rapid advancements. You know, we&rsquo;ve only had flights occurring, you know, in the 1913 era. So 1930s is only 20 years after flights. You&rsquo;ve got the expansion of a number of technologies, including radio itself. Of. So. Chicken Heart is is kind of in conversation with some of these fears and you know, kind of technological determinism that is taking up around science at the moment. The kind of humorous of science and 37, I mean, while World War 2 hasn&rsquo;t occurred yet, that won&rsquo;t be until 1939. And Germanys&rsquo;s invasion of Poland. Nevertheless, you&rsquo;ve still got. What is it? I think the Marco Polo incidents occurred with Japan and China launching that conflict between Japan going through into China. So we&rsquo;re really at the brink of World War 2 during this time. I mean, there&rsquo;s a lot of of of stress that&rsquo;s occurring here. I mean, Hitler&rsquo;s in power, Hitler&rsquo;s starting to gobble up little spots. I&rsquo;m not sure if Czechoslovakia. Or so Dayton land has fallen into Germany yet, but it&rsquo;s right around that period. You&rsquo;ve got Chamberlain, you&rsquo;ve got piercement occurring. We&rsquo;re at the brink of war, right? It&rsquo;s certainly gearing up. So I think this, this theme that we&rsquo;ll hear about in chicken heart of. And unstoppable destructive force. Is is certainly. I think in conversation with that point in history, so a little bit of media induced panic. So as you&rsquo;re listening to this, think about, you know, if you turn the lights out literally the name of the horror serial, this is broadcast in it&rsquo;s lights out. So turn those lights out. Listen to this episode. Think about whether it could induce a bit of panic. What&rsquo;s also interesting about? The final point about chicken heart before we listen to. Is, as we&rsquo;ll unpack. The fact that you&rsquo;ve got some really memorable comedy interpretations. Yeah, Bill Cosby&rsquo;s famous retelling as well as it being in Stephen King&rsquo;s book dance Macabre, which is his analysis of horror as a genre, what makes horror work. And he talked specifically about chicken heart. So let&rsquo;s give a listen now to the 1937 chicken heart. This has been remastered again. It&rsquo;s a classic from radio. Horror. And created by Arch Uber. You know one of the big masters of. Terror that we&rsquo;ll listen to. So here is chicken heart. We&rsquo;ll play the whole thing. It only goes to 7 minutes. 40 seconds. So sit back, enjoy, grab a coffee or tea and listen to chicken heart.
Speaker 4
Do you remember some time ago in an eastern scientific institution? They kept the peace of heart alive for weeks on end. Well, I got to thinking, what if that heart began to grow? And grow and grow. Grow.
Speaker 5
Hello. Hello. Operator. Give me Mr Reagan fast. Hello, Mr Reagan. This is Lewis. Listen, get me a rewrite, man. The things still growing. No cheap. I tell you the truth. That corridors choked with living, crawling flesh. No, no, no, I&rsquo;m not drunk. I&rsquo;m telling you the truth. That little piece of flesh has grown until now. It&rsquo;s. Jamming that building. All inside the space of an hour. You&rsquo;ve got to believe me. It&rsquo;s the greatest news story of the generation. And here you argue with me. I tell you, it&rsquo;s the truth. You&rsquo;ve got to believe in you.
Speaker 3
You must believe me, I tell you, the only hope is to burn the building to. The ground that one. Now, wait a minute. Wait. A minute. Take it. I tell you. Burn it to the. Ground burn and I tell you, take it. Easy. I sent in a call. Don&rsquo;t you understand? For some reason I cannot even imagine, this tissue is doubling in size every hour. Do you know what that means? In another hour it will be twice the size it is now, and long before that it will break open the building with the force of its pressure, and then it will be free in the street. Do you hear me? Free. On the street and then those those tentacles of protoplasm stretching out to feed on anything they can reach.
Speaker 6
What&rsquo;s happening? You see the walls cracking? They want. I want you.
Speaker 3
I tried to warn them. But now it is too late. The heart is free.
Speaker 8
Where is it?
Speaker 7
Gentlemen, gentlemen, come to order. Please, gentlemen. Please. Quiet, quiet, please. Please. Please now as mayor, no one realises more than I do the necessity of immediate action in terming this unspeakable unbelievable emergency. Can I assure you that I.
Speaker 8
I cut the speeches, Mike, that blasted thing is spreading like a forest fire. All the governor.
Speaker 7
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, Please wait here. Is Doctor Albert from the Research Institute. Speak. Step up here. Doctor, do so.
Speaker 9
Aaron.
Speaker 10
Let&rsquo;s see what he says.
Speaker 3
Gentlemen. It was in my institute this horror began. And if you give me a chance, perhaps I can stop it. What is your?
Speaker 7
Doctor, tell us first what that monster really is, yes.
Speaker 3
Yes, I will tell you that great ever growing mass of flesh it is or it was a chicken heart.
Speaker 7
Hard. Are you crazy?
Speaker 5
Men.
Speaker 7
Yes. Chicken heart. Chicken heart. Listen to me, you fool. Listen, listen. Up there, who knows what he&rsquo;s talking about.
Speaker 3
I tell you that mass of flesh was a chicken heart, the tissue of which for some reason is undergoing constant, rapid, accelerating growth with every passing hour, its growth is doubling. Do you know what that means? If it is now one block in size within 30 hours, that cannibal flesh will have increased in size. To 1 square block to the 30th power in 30 hours. Every inch of this whole city will be crushed under that moving. Within 60 hours it will have covered the entire state within two weeks, the entire United States. You ask for the National Guard. I say call out the entire army. We&rsquo;ll ask this thing off the earth.
Speaker 8
Already Keith pumpers already all hoses coupled up. We&rsquo;ll flood that thing with water from all.
Speaker 10
Angles alright, here&rsquo;s the signal.
Speaker 7
Open them up full blast.
Speaker 8
Chief work out. That&rsquo;s reaching out. Get back everybody, everybody.
Speaker 3
Is what good is water? I told them the only hope is artillery. Bums.
Speaker 10
All National Guardsmen report to your armouries. All National Guardsmen report to your armouries. General mobilisation.
Speaker 8
Battery in position, Sir.
Speaker 10
Firing on the album.
Speaker 7
Sir.
Speaker 11
Then.
Speaker 3
Aye.
Speaker 9
Hi here.
Speaker 3
Useless. It has grown too large and it grows too quickly. The flesh is already engulfing the guns. They came too late.
Speaker 5
You all right now, Doctor Albert? Yes.
Speaker 3
Yes, I&rsquo;m all right, Mr. Lewis.
Speaker 5
Well, I sure am glad I located you. I stole as long as I could. Another 10 minutes and we could have taken off that blasted protoplasm or whatever it is was sucking at the wheels by the. Time we left the. Yes, yes, I saw 5000 feet. Well, we&rsquo;ll cruise around up here for a few minutes and. Then head W it will.
Speaker 3
Do no good.
Speaker 5
You can&rsquo;t mean it it it must stop growing sometime it must.
Speaker 3
Look at it down there. The grey blankets of evil covering. See how the roads are black with men and women and their children running for their lives. See how the protoplasmic grave reaches out and engulfs them. See.
Speaker 5
Stop it. Stop talking like that. We&rsquo;ll get away the government. They&rsquo;ll send bombing planes, poison gas.
Speaker 3
No. Listen to me, Lewis. You remember only a handful of days ago you asked me my prophecy of the end of the. With you remember my answer? Ohh such a scholarly prophecy. Cessation of Earth rotation. Mighty sounding astronomical theories. But now this is reality. Lewis. The end has come for humanity. Not in the red of atomic fusion. Not in the glory of interstellar combustion. Not in the piece of white. Hold silence, but with that, that creeping, grasping flesh below us. It is a joke. Hey, Lewis, a great joke. The joke of the cosmos. The end of mankind.
Speaker 6
No.
Speaker 11
Oh.
Speaker 3
Because of the chickens.
Speaker 9
No, we won&rsquo;t die. I can&rsquo;t die. I&rsquo;ll find a safe landing somewhere. I&rsquo;ll find a place. The motor. It&rsquo;s cut out. We&rsquo;re a spin. I can&rsquo;t get.
Speaker 3
Out of it, I told you, doom. No, no mankind. Doom. No.
Speaker 9
We&rsquo;re falling right into it, into the heart.
Craig
All right. There we have it. The chicken heart. One of the classic all time horror. Radio dramas. Let&rsquo;s break this down first in terms of bleak Snyders see if the cat theory or script writing we&rsquo;ve. Looked at black, bleak. Snyder, before he has proposed a number of ways in which, if you want to write a great movie, there&rsquo;s. Specific number of story beats. You&rsquo;ve gotta make sure you tick off. Let&rsquo;s see if breaking down. Chicken hearts align strongly and reveals this kind of classic story build building structure that saves the cat is built around, so Snyder starts with the idea that you&rsquo;ve got to start strongly with a good opening image. You&rsquo;ve got to establish the world through that so. The radio drama Chicken Heart starts with the scientist talking about, you know, remember when they were able to create a heart. So establishing the idea of science, establishing the idea of science, being able to create amazing things. And this idea of hubris, right, that we&rsquo;re we&rsquo;re setting up this. Environment this this world where humans are masters over nature, they&rsquo;re able to create anything they want, including a heart. So that&rsquo;s the establishing image that first seen and we quickly go to the reporter setting up the theme, which is the report is calling back to his office. With a panic tone staying, you know? Ohh my God. It&rsquo;s about to explode, right? The building that the heart was in as as, as you know, the the the heart&rsquo;s been growing, it&rsquo;s going to burst the walls and we have the scientists trying to warn everyone that this thing is just going to keep growing. So that&rsquo;s kind of setting up this theme of of scientific ambition and and panic. Around the consequences if they become uncontrollable, so that that&rsquo;s pretty much immediately the second scene we see that nicely as Snyder is saying, establishing the theme. You know panic. Scientific hubris, unchecked experiment, and then we have this setup as the hearts growing. We&rsquo;re becoming aware of it. The fourth story beat that Snyder talks about is is an inciting incident. And it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s around I guess the the walls have broken from the building that contain the hearts. So I&rsquo;d say that&rsquo;s probably the scene that&rsquo;s the inciting incident. The fact that this heart is now growing uncontrollably, that&rsquo;s the catalyst that then sets up the rest of the story, which is how are we going to stop this heart? Growing. Right. What&rsquo;s going on? They&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re. They&rsquo;re now realising that this scientific experiment is spiralling out of control, so we have seen five. Well story 5, which is the debate. Can it be stopped? So we have this classic scene where scientists, the mayors there and they&rsquo;re all struggling to figure out how they&rsquo;re going to fix this. They&rsquo;re debating. Possible solutions? So we break now into Act 2. This is storytelling .6, which is the point of no return, right? So at this point the heart has continued to escape containment. We have the great scene. Where the local authorities are trying to use water, right, they&rsquo;ve got the hoses out and they&rsquo;re just trying to hose it down and it&rsquo;s not working right. So there&rsquo;s a sense of dread that&rsquo;s creeping in that the world now is in full crisis mode. Water is not worked. The scientist has said, I told the fools what wouldn&rsquo;t work. They&rsquo;ve got to use artillery and bombs. Alright. So then we move into storytelling beat 7, which is fun and games. As the horror escalates. You&rsquo;ve got the great scenes of that, you know, artillery being called in, the bombs being directed, the militaries involved, all these escalating panic movements as they&rsquo;re futilely, they&rsquo;re futile, ISM, they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re not able to destroy the heart with any of the fun and games. That Snyder refers to as this story beat as we see a series of of kind of kind of core horror spectacles being described to us in the radio drama. There&rsquo;s no real sense of well, there&rsquo;s a kind of a false hope, right? So the false hope would be that scene near the end where the scientist is on the. The aeroplane, right. We had that scene where the his, his assistant or or helper has managed to get the aeroplane off the ground. The scientist that was involved in the research has made it onto that aeroplane and. And it. It&rsquo;s a kind of midpoint, false hope moment where it looks like they might be able to get out of it. Right. So the pilots say, you know, we&rsquo;ll just circle around a bit. We&rsquo;ll try to figure out what to do next. But that effort is all in fail because we&rsquo;re at Story Week 9, which is the bad guys closing right this chicken heart, the bad guy, the villain, the force of Nature has continued to expand. The scientist in the aeroplane is just saying it&rsquo;s all hopeless. Destruction is inevitable. Story bit 10 all is lost, right? There&rsquo;s a final realisation, right? The the pilots refusing to acknowledge this. I know I can&rsquo;t die now. This can&rsquo;t happen. But who&rsquo;s lost? And we&rsquo;re now into a full dystopic, pessimistic story with story beat 11 dark night of the soul. So the scientist and the pilots in the aeroplane now confronts their powerlessness, right? And the scientist. Kind of reflects on his own humour. This, and we reached this wonderful kind of finale right where the growth of the hearts being recognised as impossible to stop this kind of ultimate horror is being seen below them. He&rsquo;s talking about the grey heart, the little black dots of people trying to escape. We have the finale where this height is is is consuming everything and that that theme of that we established in scene one with the reporters cooling his base at the scientists saying, you know, those fools have got to listen to. Me that these unchecked forces are now beyond human control, with a wonderful final image.
Speaker 1
Which is a.
Craig
Sound effect image, of course. For radio of the splats of the the aeroplane losing its engine right and spiralling out of control, and this wonderful final sound of the SPLAT as the aeroplane crashes into the heart. So it&rsquo;s certainly a really strong. Story in terms of breaking it down in those fourteen save the cat story beats in terms of where Snyder would place this as a genre. As you know, he he defines genres in terms of specifically memorable thought. So it&rsquo;s not a horror genre. He would say this is a monster in the house. Subgenre right where you have this unstoppable force, right. The monster in the house, which is just wreaking havoc in this case due to human error. Right, the scientists tubers. And it&rsquo;s got that classic structure that follows the kind of escalating tension and inevitable doom story. So it&rsquo;s considered a classic of being able to map that out. It&rsquo;s a wonderful kind of inevitable doom. 7 minutes, 7 1/2. And it&rsquo;s packs in a lot. And again, Bill Cosby&rsquo;s little comedy routine on his experience as a child listening to this drives that home. But before you get to Bill Cosby, let&rsquo;s listen to how Stephen King, the well known horror author, explains why he thinks. Chicken heart matters. And it&rsquo;s really important to listen to, even to it now. So this is in Stephen King&rsquo;s dance macabre book, which is his writing about why horror works, how it works in movies, how it works in literature, and what we&rsquo;re going to be hearing about is, is a little snippet from the audio book. Created by William Derfus derfus. So we&rsquo;ll listen to hear Steven you talking about the importance of radio horror and in particular, the author of it, Arch Ublas. Chicken heart.
Speaker 1
3. We&rsquo;re almost done with our brief discussion of radio. Now. I think that to do much more would be to risk droning along like one of those tiresome cinema buffs want to spend the night telling you how Charlie Chaplin was the greatest screen actor who ever lived, or that the Clint Eastwood spaghetti Westerns stand at the apex of the existential absurdist movement. But no discussion of the phenomenon of radio terror, no matter how brief, would be complete without some mention of the genres Primo 2. Not Orson Welles, but Arch Oboler, the first playwright to have his own National Radio series, the chilling Lights out. Lights out was actually broadcast in the 40s, but enough of the programmes were rebroadcast in the 50s and even in the 60s. For me to feel I can justify their inclusion here. The one I remember most vividly from its rebroadcast on Dimension X was the chicken heart that ate the world oboler like so many people in the horror field, Alfred Hitchcock, as another prime example, are extremely alert to the humour implicit in horror, and this alertness was never on better view than in the chicken. Art story made you giggle at its very absurdity, even as the goose flesh raced up and down your arms.
Speaker
Which?
Speaker 1
You remember that only a few days ago you asked me my opinion on how the world would end. The scholarly scientist who is unwittingly perpetrated the horror on an unsuspecting world solemnly tells his young protege as they fly at 5000 feet in a light plain over the ever growing chicken heart. You remember my answer. Uh, such a scholarly prophecy. Mighty sounding theories about cessation of Earth, rotation, entropy, but now this is reality, Lewis. The end is come for humanity. Not in the red of atomic fusion, not in the glory of interstellar combustion. Not in the piece of white cold silence. But with that, that creeping, grasping flesh below us.
Speaker 12
It was a joke. Gay Lewis. The joke of the cosmos, the end of mankind because of a chicken heart.
Speaker 1
No Louis jibbers. No, I can&rsquo;t die. I&rsquo;ll find a safe landing place. But then, perfectly on cue, the comforting drone of a planes engine in the background becomes a coughing stutter. We&rsquo;re in a spin, Lewis screams.
Speaker 12
The end of all mankind.
Speaker 1
The doctor proclaims and stentorian tones and the two of them falled directly into the chicken heart. We hear it. Steady, beat louder, louder, and then the sickly splash that ends the play. Part of Obler&rsquo;s real genius was that when Chicken Heart ended, you felt like laughing and throwing up at the same time. Cue the bombers, an old radio bit used to run drone of bombers in the background. The minds eye visualises a sky black with flying forts. Dropped the ice cream into Puget Sound. The voice continues. Whining hydraulic sound of Bombay&rsquo;s opening a rising whistle followed by a gigantic splash. All right. Cue the chocolate syrup, the whipped cream. And drop the maraschino cherry. Is. We hear a great liquid squishing sound as the chocolate syrup goes, then a huge hissing as the whipped cream follows. These sounds are followed by a heavy plop, plop, plop in the background. And, absurd as it may be, the mind responds to these cues that interior eye actually sees a series of gigantic ice cream sundaes rising out of Puget Sound like strange volcanic. Stones, each with a maraschino cherry the size of Seattle&rsquo;s Kingdom. On top of it. In fact, we see those disgustingly red cocktail cherries raining down, plopping into all thou whipped cream and leaving craters nearly the size of great Tycho. Thank the genius of Stan Freberg. Arch Oboler A restlessly intelligent man who was also involved in. Movies 5 one of the first films to deal with the survival of Mankind after World War 3 was Obler&rsquo;s brainchild. And the legitimate theatre utilised 2 of radios. Great strengths. The first in the minds innate obedience, its willingness to try to see whatever someone suggests it see, no matter how absurd the second is, the fact that fear and horror are blinding emotions that knock our adult pins from beneath us. That leave us groping in the dark like children who cannot find the light. Radio is, of course, the blind medium, and only obler used it so well or so completely. Of course, our modern years pick up the necessary conventions of the medium that have been outgrown, mostly due to our growing dependence on the visual and our. Set of reality. But these were standard practises which audiences of the day had no trouble accepting. Like tornieri&rsquo;s paper mache, Rockwall and cat people. If these conventions seem jarring to listeners of the 80s, as the asides in a Shakespearean play seemed jarring to a novice playgoer, then that is our problem to work out as best we can. One of these conventions is the constant use of narration to move the story. A second is dialogue as description, a technique necessary to radio but one TV, and the movies have rendered obsolete. Here, for instance, from the chicken heart that ate the world is Doctor Albert&rsquo;s discussing the chicken heart itself with Louis. Read the passage and then ask yourself how true this speech rings to your TV and movie trained ears. Look at it down there. A great blanket of evil covering everything. See how the roads are black with men and women and their children fleeing for their lives. See how the protoplasmic grey reaches out and engulfs them. On TV, this would be laughed out of cord as total corn. It is not hip as they say. But heard in the darkness, coupled with the drone of the light planes engine in the background, it worked very well indeed. Willingly or unwillingly, the mind conjures up the image. Oboler wants this great Jelly like BLOB beating rhythmically, swallowing up the refugees as they run. Ironically, television in the early talkies both depended on the largely auditory conventions of radio. Until these, alright, we&rsquo;ll.
Craig
Post this that. Stephen King talking about why Chicken Heart works so well and how we really need to rewire ourselves to think about how. You know. Radio works as a theatre of the mind. How it doesn&rsquo;t draw upon the same types of suspension of disbelief that we&rsquo;ve become familiar with through TV and movies, where we want to visualise it. We want to see it. There&rsquo;s pleasure in the watching of it here. It&rsquo;s all in the minds eye and as king. Asks us when we listen to or read that last scene. That final scene of the scientists giving up hope and saying we&rsquo;re all doomed. And looking down at the pulsating, growing, fleshy heart. Again, he says, you know, this work to our TV is and his feeling is it&rsquo;s quite laughable. It wouldn&rsquo;t. So let&rsquo;s dive further into that idea of the theatre of the mind and how effectively it can work as kings setting out here. He&rsquo;s saying it&rsquo;s a really significant moment. To imagine through your mind&rsquo;s eye the theatre of the mind, which really. Is able to do. By listening to one of the other important cultural effects that chicken heart had on pop culture, and this is Bill Cosby&rsquo;s famous 1966 album Wonderfulness. Which was part of one of his. Live comedy acts and this is his famous discussion of chicken hearts. Of course, Bill Cosby famous. For you know. Fat, Alberts, Cosby, kids and so forth, and equally probably more infamous now for his criminal activities. And law cases against him and being found guilty of rape, SO1 can&rsquo;t unpack that from what we&rsquo;re about to hear, important to say, of course, and deeply problematic individual. People. But let&rsquo;s listen to this famous comedy routine he has, which I do think speaks to Stephen King&rsquo;s point around trying to understand how theatre of the mind works and how effective Arch Ogler was with chicken hearts at creating this. So let&rsquo;s listen now to a a little bit from the sketch. From the 1966 album Wonderfulness by Bill Cosby.
Speaker 11
Go ahead, scare me to. I&rsquo;m ready. I&rsquo;m ready. Scare me, man. Come on now. And welcome to. Lights. Ohh yeah, yeah, yeah, go ahead. Scare me. I was dumb enough to do whatever the guy said to do on the radio. Turn your lights off. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. To round, go on, scare me to death. I&rsquo;m ready. Tonight&rsquo;s episode is about a chicken heart. A chicken heart that ate up New York City. Yeah, go chicken heart. Go, go get him. Eat him up. Chicken heart scare me to death. I&rsquo;m. I&rsquo;m ready. I&rsquo;m ready. The Chicken heart was kept alive. 5. In a laboratory and of that special solution, half blood, half sodium solution, right? One day a careless janitor. Knock that over, he went to get away to clean it up. The chicken heart grew. 6 foot 5 inches and in search. Of human blood. The janitor came back, opened the door. Them up.
Speaker 9
What?
Speaker 11
Go get him chicken high. Go get him. Go get him. It moved out into the hallway, rang for the elevator.
Speaker 13
4th floor.
Speaker 11
Go get him chicken high. Go get him. You will. Moved out into the street. Ate up all the cabs. The Empire State Building. Ate up their jersey Turnpike. It&rsquo;s in your home state. It&rsquo;s outside of your door. And it&rsquo;s going to eat you up.
Speaker 13
Ohh, got my jello star spirited all over the floor. I set the sofa on fire. You won&rsquo;t come there smoking fire and jello. My father came in the house and what? 1000 sober doing on fire coming out of the chicken was gonna eat. OK, zip. What chicken are you talking about? Who went on the radio show? You the idiot. Turn it off.
Speaker 11
I hadn&rsquo;t thought of that. For two years, anybody that passed by our House.
Speaker 14
Hmm. My father, whether he knew him or not, would call him in. Hey, come on. I want to. Show you my dumb kid. Ohh and tell him you burn up $100 sofa and broke your father&rsquo;s arm. Save us from that.
Craig
So that&rsquo;s the classic 1966 Bill Cosby routine. Chicken hearts again, I think really putting you in the feeling of listening to that live. With a panic that can trigger into ones imagination. And of course, what&rsquo;s interesting here is, you know Bill Cosby. Acknowledging the again talking about how Stuart Hall would talk about the reading positions here, you&rsquo;ve got the dominant reading position of Chicken Heart, which is it&rsquo;s a really good Horror Story, right? It has this good escalating horror that&rsquo;s going to it, which interestingly, Bill Cosby sets up and in a really kind of fan fiction way. Actually embellishes and explains how the hearts started to grow. That a janitor accidentally knocked over some chemical the chemical got into the heart and just caused this unlikely growth of the heart that the scientists had had had kept alive. So one that you have the dominant reading, but then? You have, you know, Bill. Cosby, which is kind of doing his own, it&rsquo;s a. Version of that. For comedy effect, talking about, you know, if you if you took it literally, it suddenly becomes insane. It says it&rsquo;s weird that you would believe this suddenly. So much so that you&rsquo;d set. Lie to you&rsquo;re so fit to protect yourself, and again the whole absurdity of listening to the. Escalating horror that you you you&rsquo;re only listening to radio show yet it seems so real. It seems like it&rsquo;s happening so much like a year later. From this you&rsquo;ll have awesome wells or the world&rsquo;s broadcast, which notoriously led to people arming themselves, getting out of their homes to try to defend their communities. That that they. Were seeing this as real equally here for comedy Effect, Bill Cosby&rsquo;s comic retelling of it being that kind. Of you know. It&rsquo;s looking at it on paper, as Stephen King says, it&rsquo;s. Kind of laughable. How can this chicken heart be so terrifying? That is absurd. Yet it is this masterful, I think, combination of of of you know, comic, horror and and kind of over identifying with the fear as a Zizek, Zizek the philosopher. Would talk about this, this, this kind of humour that occurs with extreme. Year where the terror is so ratchet it up that it gets to a point of absurdity which you know is, I think, the heart of Bill Cosby&rsquo;s comedy routine there and and and also. Yeah. Obviously some listeners have have have registered that. Thanks Anna for smashing in. I&rsquo;m glad it was fun to listen to that on the way home in the car. Because yeah, I think it does hold up 1937. This broadcast was first made, but it&rsquo;s such an effective bit of. Of horror that it&rsquo;s. Worthy of of unpacking it and also looking at the cultural impact it&rsquo;s had, Steven. Being fantastic, one of the best horror authors, as well as Bill Cosby, turning it both into a bit of cultural touchstone to discuss. You know, Bill Cosby&rsquo;s 1966 community and dance macabre. What came out in the early 80s. So there you&rsquo;re looking at 20 year periods where this. Cultural touchstone of the 1937 radio drama You know still gets discussed and talked about. The other thing that&rsquo;s so interesting I think about.
Speaker
Yes.
Craig
The chicken heart is this idea of, you know, the the absurd logic of it, that the system that you see that&rsquo;s occurring around the chicken hearts, you know that, you know, the science system, the military system, the police system, the journalism system. All it does is kind of reinforces what they&rsquo;re trying to stop, right? So they&rsquo;re all trying to stop the growth of the chicken hearts. And again, this is what Zizek says is so powerful about horror stories that often they&rsquo;re these tales. Of trying to stop the threats and particularly where the story is, you know, the darks tea time of the soul, the kind of, you know, and we lose, it&rsquo;s about the system itself being broken, that the system itself is trying to stop the threat. But the more it tries to stop the threat, the worse the threat. That&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s bringing more amplification to the threat. And this is Isaac. &lsquo;S theory of how he sees. Some abuses of power occurring, some kind of logics of of of ideology, that are growing exponentially and out of control, that the system might have begun with good intentions, but as it&rsquo;s released some destructive force, the more that the system tries to stop that destruction. It in so. Amplifies it. So again, interesting kind of resonances. I think with Trump&rsquo;s response to California today, right? How is it that the system, you know, claims of trying to stop violence yet still escalate violence? Right. So this logic, this paradox between. Just like the chicken heart, the expanding Organism. Which is paradoxically, being accelerated by its growth as. More bombing is occurring. More attempts to destroy it is happening, so there&rsquo;s some really interesting philosophical questions that are occurring there as well as, as you know, Stephen King&rsquo;s pointing out a really master class in how to create a story in 7 1/2 minutes. That is about the escalation of horror, the escalation of terror that works so effectively in radio. So it&rsquo;s worth, you know if you&rsquo;ve got a bit of time going back listening to lights out, a great 1930s forties radio serial drama. We&rsquo;ve talked about other great moments in horror radio dramas like the thing on the FOURBLE board, which is more of a psychological horror. Chicken heart is pretty much. A fantastic example of more of your minimalist horror where the sound effects do all the heavy lifting for the for the panic, whereas the thing on the fourble board which is considered to be another great horror radio drama, really escalates that through this eerie narration. As the characters interact, listen back to our episode on. The thing on the forward board for more discussion on that. But yeah, we&rsquo;ll. Dip into some more radio drama and piece together why it still matters in future shows. Again, I hope you thought the chicken heart was a nice bit of timeless horror, and in particular, listen back to it. Think of how sound based. Fear works, and if it&rsquo;s still effective today as it was in 1937, turn those lights out and listen to it. And see if, umm, you know a true experience of horror isn&rsquo;t just about monsters, but maybe about our inability to control the unknown. So that&rsquo;s medium other for another week, we&rsquo;ll be taking a break next week as they do a little bit of field research up in Launceston to bring some new interesting. Freeze to the airwaves in a fortnight time so no show. Next Thursday the 19th of June. Thanks everyone for listening to me and mother shipments. Radio. You can listen back to other audio notes for the show on your podcast supplier of choice. As well as catch visuals of the show on YouTube and Twitch, keep listening now to some really cool edge radio tunes.

   Speaker 1
There is nothing wrong with your radio.
Speaker
Do not attempt to adjust the volume. We are controlling the broader questo. For the next hour, we will control all that you hear.
Speaker 1
You are about to experience the knowledge and insights of the medium mothership.
Craig
Alright, welcome here to media mothership on Edge Radio 99.3 FM. The sound effects in the background. That&rsquo;s absolutely fine. We&rsquo;re broadcasting.
Speaker
Ohh.
Craig
Out of Edge radio. Studios in Nepal, Luna, Hobart TAS and on this show we explore how media shapes our understanding of the world around us. I&rsquo;m your host, Craig, joined by Taylor. Hello. And Ronan, hi. And we&rsquo;re streaming on edgeradio.org dot AU as well as on YouTube and Twitch. You can find us just by searching media mothership. Message in on the chat at YouTube. Or twitch or. SMS US on 0488811. 707.
Taylor
Yeah, 0488811. 707.
Craig
We&rsquo;ll do our best. To keep an eye on the monitors around us, hopefully.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
So today&rsquo;s topic, we&rsquo;re going to cover some interesting news around media and popular culture. Cool as well as if we have time on the media mothership website. I&rsquo;ve been uploading a classic academic work. Created by me, it&rsquo;s my 1996. It was awarded so this research was done in 1995, so 30.
Taylor
The year after I. Was born. Wow.
Craig
30 years ago.
Speaker 4
Yes, so you&rsquo;re 3231.
Taylor
That&rsquo;ll be 30 this year, OK.
Craig
So yeah, I guess this was Ground Zero for you. This was my honours thesis looking, called manga dreaming. Irresponsible images of cyberpunk anime? Yeah. So you were born into the age of manga dreaming. A lot of irresponsible images, and so we we might dive into that looking at that kind of VHS era of anime in the mid 90s and late 80s and. Great. Yeah. Thank you. The the Audio&rsquo;s working. We&rsquo;ve got some chat live. Informing us Hilda is working, so it&rsquo;s fantastic. Thank you. Twix, Twix, Twix, the dragon. So before we go any further, I&rsquo;ve got a musical accompaniment guest today. Ronan&rsquo;s doing music on the kalimba. Yeah, the piano. So we&rsquo;ll go to news now. So to bring us over to news, we&rsquo;ll play our theme song. Nice. That&rsquo;s great. Yeah. We push the the mic towards it as well. That&rsquo;s great. Yep. Yep. And.
Taylor
Wow an octave.
Craig
All right, so news. So, Taylor, you you reminded me of this story. Leaked files reveal how China is using AI to erase the history of the Tenement square massacre. What&rsquo;s interesting to me about this piece was a article leads. With this image. Which? Pointing out that even a picture of 1 banana and four apples in a line could be flagged because it shares a similar sequence with the Tank Man photo, right? So the tank Man photo is that classic photo of the protester. The Chinese guy with like. Groceries in both hands. Who&rsquo;s standing in front of a tank during the tenement square kind of protest period and brings to a stop these four huge tax. Of course, as we know in China, there&rsquo;s been a long history of erasing.
Speaker
All.
Craig
Discussion around the 1989 Tenement square massacre from public view and still. 36 years. Since Beijing still censoring that information and has not disclosed the official death toll of this bloody crackdown that occurred. On June 4.
Ronan
Well.
Craig
So this image is really interesting though, so how so the arrangement of the one banana and four apples were basically the four green apples represents the tanks, and you&rsquo;ve got one banana standing on its end at one of the end of the line of apples. So it&rsquo;s intriguing, isn&rsquo;t it? How? And in terms of? Meaning making the dominant reading, negotiated, reading and resistant reading that you could have of the the apple banana structures.
Ronan
According to.
Speaker
Sure.
Taylor
You see, I&rsquo;ve I&rsquo;ve. I&rsquo;ve just been trying to do a bit of a a Google at the moment I can&rsquo;t find it, but it just it just reminded me of like how they&rsquo;re. Training AI for that.
Craig
To detect monitor and sensor images.
Taylor
To to detect sort of like a composition. It&rsquo;s the training AI to detect a sort of composition, no matter how it is, that sort of thing. And it reminded me of how Renaissance paintings all have that sort of that swirl thing. Do you do you? Do you? Know about that. Ohh like uh.
Craig
You know davinci&rsquo;s Adam and God moment of touching. There&rsquo;s a swell thing. Wasn&rsquo;t that, Da Vinci Code. You&rsquo;re the da Vinci. Code I know.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
The conspiracy theory, or that it&rsquo;s a brain.
Taylor
No, I&rsquo;m talking about like, how. In Renaissance art, you have you have this sort of like spiral, which is like a shell, and then you have like, the focal point in the middle of that shell. And then all of these different things being composed in a different manner. So it&rsquo;s like a a sort of spiral sort of thing. It just sort of reminded me of that. Because lots of Renaissance paintings also have that similar composition as well.
Craig
If there&rsquo;s any Assassin&rsquo;s Creed players out there. Who?
Speaker
Oh yeah.
Craig
Played that level. Let us know. But it is interesting in terms of like you. Know I always like referring back to. Stuart Hall and. The meaning of silent.
Taylor
I I refer back to Stuart Hall all.
Speaker 4
The time.
Craig
She had one of the great theorists, one of his biggest theories was the kind of dominant reading of an image like how are images given meaning? Often you&rsquo;ve got a dominant image, a dominant meaning. Sorry. So for instance. The image of the tenement square protester might be one of the dominant meaning for the West is is resistance. Then you got a negotiated reading where it might be. Well, you know, part of this suggestion, resistance. But also you&rsquo;ve got to understand, you know, this guy&rsquo;s not really resisting. He came across it. Why is the tank driver doing it? And then the resistant reading is 1, which opposes that which might flip it on its head and say it&rsquo;s all the conspiracy. That that never took place, that it was staged and so forth. So it&rsquo;s interesting when you&rsquo;re given the symbology of the banana and for apples, how what they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re saying there is that the from the censorship point of view is the dominant reading of that is the tenement square massacre. Yeah. For many people, they might negotiate that and say, well, it&rsquo;s a beautiful.
Taylor
OK, I found it.
Craig
Apple banana arrangement, yes.
Taylor
That was, it&rsquo;s not a good image. It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s very poorly done in blender, but the one I was talking about was the golden. Ratio. OK.
Speaker
Golden.
Taylor
Used in Renaissance art. This this mathematical ratio, when applied to a square, creates A spiral that guides the viewer&rsquo;s eye and is therefore considered aesthetically pleasing.
Ronan
Your reference.
Craig
Is that the JoJo reference?
Ronan
JoJo.
Craig
Isn&rsquo;t that a meme?
Ronan
Yeah, the golden. What&rsquo;s it called? Again. Golden spiral. Yeah. Golden Golden Ratio is is a is a JoJo reference because the main character in.
Taylor
Oh yeah, price here. Sorry.
Ronan
Was good again. Part 7 uses the golden ratio to spin his spin. This certain type of bowl that he uses well and if if you spin it correctly.
Taylor
OK.
Speaker 4
Right.
Ronan
It&rsquo;s the golden ratio of spinning and it infinitely spins, OK.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
Beyblade players.
Taylor
Like all the old Renaissance infinitely spins on the wall.
Craig
Love that, yes. I thought all the J references were based on music, yes.
Ronan
The stanza whose stand powers are but only the. Part after part like almost, it&rsquo;s basically just. For mangakas playlist.
Craig
Well, we get around to manga after the deep dive into the next China story, which I. Didn&rsquo;t engage in. It&rsquo;s a video game. OK, global video game called Helldivers 2, where you play in this fictional far future setting.
Taylor
Oh, is this where you play the the start of the trailer for it?
Craig
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I played the trailer for. It a couple episodes ago. It&rsquo;s. Based on kind of a Starship Troopers vibe where you&rsquo;re eradicating bugs and various threats to humanity, it&rsquo;s a third person shooter. You know, it&rsquo;s really interesting about it is there will be these storytelling moments where it really spills into the real world in a weird way. Trump. Trump&rsquo;s not involved. China is involved this time, America. Was involved, but in a kind of good way. This was following the recent battle for Super Earth, where Super Earth was under threat from these illuminated. Datas. And anyway, it needed. It gained the attention in China because uh, one of the last cities was modelled after Shanghai, right? So it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s kind of this far future thing and this was the last bastion. Is that right, Ronan, you were playing that.
Taylor
OK.
Craig
Days.
Ronan
Ohh yeah like 1.
Craig
Day one day and Garrett playing any days anyway, Shanghai was holding out the event, got featured in the chat about hey, we&rsquo;ve really got to hold off. And the thing that was crazy about it was that it was featured on a real Chinese news show called the Kunka News Morning Shanghai. And they praised how both the Chinese and non Chinese players collaborated together to defend the attack that was. Occurring we&rsquo;ll play a bit of. The I think you&rsquo;ll understand it when we hear the the news broadcast.
Taylor
OK.
Speaker
What are you?
Taylor
Just some ASMR.
Craig
I&rsquo;ll translate a defence of Shanghai that takes place within the game. It originally happened on May 20th. A version update. Has been released for a shooter called Helldivers 2. In the game setting, Alien invasion of virtual Earth, each of the seven landmarks on Earth corresponding to Shanghai right? Anyway, so basically what happened in the story was.
Taylor
OK.
Craig
You know the Chinese players. Delegated some of the time to the American players, the. Chinese players were were were. Defending during the day to help save the earth from this invasion and the American players they organised through chat to make sure the American players would hold off during the. Right, what&rsquo;s? What&rsquo;s kind of amusing is with that broadcast. There&rsquo;s a real news broadcast saying basically how wonderful it was that China and America came together to help defeat this invasion in the game. And the way they put it is fantastic. They say Chinese players were battling the enemies during the daytime. And.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
Using their excellent shooting skills and strategic plans. And then they talk about how then they say, and then the American players took over the nighttime operations using utilising air drops and firepower to construct the defence line for Shanghai.
Taylor
So is is it like a a a multiplayer online game?
Craig
Yeah. Yeah, it&rsquo;s a Co-op game, so it&rsquo;s not a PvP game. It&rsquo;s a close game where you&rsquo;re.
Taylor
OK. So yeah, against against the environment, PV E Yeah, yeah.
Craig
Yeah, yeah. And and it is kind of synchronous. So the Davis too is got into some controversy because it&rsquo;s considered a game where the players actions will. Change the course of events potentially right? So if the players can.
Taylor
I need to get this game. It&rsquo;s a lot of fun. I need to get this game and then the headline will be maniac. Australian destroy the base.
Speaker
The.
Craig
Which these graded representation mercenary, right? But there was some controversy. Because days before the Chinese players have become so upset by the fact that they organised this defence of Shanghai, but the percentage of success or stuck at 99.9888%. And there was this big debate saying, oh. This is just. Because it&rsquo;s fake, they want us to believe that we can make a difference. But even when we come together, we can&rsquo;t get to 100%. But then other people were saying, well, it&rsquo;s a defence mission to, you know, unless they stop invading, you&rsquo;ll never get.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
To 100%.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
But yeah, a fascinating moment of politics and video games. Coming to. Either hand in hand to represent that in a really kind of undemocratic fashion. I mean, it&rsquo;s called managed democracy. You&rsquo;re pretty much playing in a in a kind of Nazi environments. One of our. Chat messages, nothing happened. Nothing happened in the game.
Ronan
I think he was talking about. The conversation a few minutes ago about Tillman Square.
Craig
Yeah, right. Yeah. Of course, something happened at Tenman Square, so this forecast shouldn&rsquo;t be censored. Hopefully by talking of disasters, the other news story I want to quickly talk about, two stories that are coming out. Around amunga that have caused. People to cancel their tourist plans to Japan.
Taylor
Wow.
Craig
Yeah, Mangas July 2025 Japan disaster prediction shakes up fear of the big one, and some are even abandoning their holiday plans. Yes, so a couple of articles talking about how this manga called Mitta.
Taylor
This earthquake.
Craig
Mid eye the future I saw, which is a fictional manga. But it&rsquo;s set of these kind of claims of of disasters that are written in this.
Taylor
Manga. Yeah, well, so does weathering with you. And that says it never stops raining ever again.
Craig
Yeah. Yeah. So so it talks about. So the past few weeks, once obscure manga has been making headlines in Japan and overseas, the author claims that. Japan will be hit by a massive natural disaster in July 2025.
Speaker
Well.
Craig
Predictions being cited as a reason some holiday makers are abandoning their summer plans to travel to Japan and has exploded across Japanese social media platforms. Why are some people apparently believing this? Mongo&rsquo;s prediction? So the article talks about how even though this was first published back in 99. And it features, yeah, the author as a character. That&rsquo;s basically riding his dream Diaries that he&rsquo;s been keeping since 1985. There&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s. Yeah, this idea that these references might he might be onto something. This kind of reference to the 252025 July concern. Yeah, it seems that. Yeah. So it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s, yeah, praying upon people superstitions. I think there was some reference in there that he got one thing correct. In the past there was one thing that was featured in the manga. Then people were sure. Oh, actually that did happen. Anyway. Look into further would. You just not go somewhere. I mean, you&rsquo;ve got some travel plans. Would you not go somewhere? If a manga depicted the disaster about to befall that.
Ronan
No, I mean not, yeah.
Taylor
Media.
Ronan
That absolutely will be an earthquake in Japan in July.
Craig
Yeah, that&rsquo;s true. Well, not all news went, but yeah, it is up for for an earthquake potentially.
Ronan
In July? Yeah. I mean, it&rsquo;s reality.
Speaker 4
Well, it might not be July.
Ronan
Geography, it&rsquo;s just like.
Craig
Yeah, yeah. I mean, it might be July, it might be next year, it might be 5 years, but yeah, it is one of those things.
Ronan
It&rsquo;s it just depends on how. Big it will be.
Craig
And it is unusual that people are starting to, you know, kind of interpret this as possibly true. But yeah, I mean, Japan is very earthquake prone, and seismologists have been, you know. Warning that there&rsquo;s possibly a mega quake around the corner. But yeah, there&rsquo;s obviously a lot of urban legend wrapping to that. You know, media influence and then, you know, going into real concerns as well, which we don&rsquo;t do on this show. So do always maintain a healthy scepticism. For news next article, I want to talk about is kind of following up the last three weeks of discussion that we&rsquo;ve done on villains. So last three weeks on the show, we&rsquo;ve been talking about how. Story writing can create great villains shown and jump in Japan is launching a campaign to find its greatest villains, so this is the Shueisha publishing company. I mean, so if you. Yeah, I mean, I&rsquo;m not sure. So yeah. Some of the anime that&rsquo;s in shown and jump includes by X family Kaiju, #8, Hell&rsquo;s Paradise Dan Dadan, which I do want to watch. And they&rsquo;re going to, yeah, decide which villain is the biggest villain of this franchise. So do go ahead. Vote now. Really. Yeah. Death note.
Taylor
I&rsquo;ve never heard of any of this. Ohh yeah, OK yeah, I know that.
Speaker 4
Death notes could be featured there. Dragon Ball.
Craig
See is.
Taylor
The only Dragon Ball ZI watched was the live action American one.
Craig
Well, that is an act of villainy in itself. That vibe, well as last news story in Japan to create digital archive of manga and anime and games. The government is set to launch a new digital archive strategy aimed at preserving and promoting Japanese trove of such cultural assets as manga, anime, and video games, which are mentioned popular among people young people.
Taylor
Well, haha, Nintendo says good luck with that.
Craig
Would be interesting video games. Yeah. I mean, there is this problem of of particularly online games. Basically, having a shelf life, which means that in 10 years time they could be unplayable because they require online engagement or online playing. Yeah. So there is, I think there is a threat that people don&rsquo;t realise that a lot of this stuff could disappear. Hmm. You know, mobile games disappear, right? Trying to archive mobile games from the early 2000s.
Speaker
Hmm.
Taylor
Ohh absolutely there was heaps of my favourite games from Adult Swim. Can&rsquo;t get anymore.
Craig
Or is it just? Just, yeah. Right. Yeah. That they would release for a short time linked to. An Adult Swim series. Yeah, this initiative is expected to have a spillover effect on charging domestic and international enthusiasts too. After seeing the digitised version. Of it to pay a visit to wherever the asset is located so you know the Ross Bakery and kick his delivery service. Michael Guernsey with this. Yeah. So the strategy emphasises that local communities should lead the decision making process for preserving local cultural and artistic work. With municipalities paying a central role in expanding and utilising digital archives. So yeah, let&rsquo;s see if we can get the Ross Bakery in the middle of Tasmania. To feature as part of the digital archiving of. Kiki&rsquo;s delivery service.
Taylor
I&rsquo;ve tried to go to the Ross Bakery every time I&rsquo;ve. Gone to Ross Ohh tried. To tried to every single time it&rsquo;s been shut.
Craig
You never made it.
Taylor
And then I went there. The most recent time I went there, they said sorry, we&rsquo;re shut for the next seven months.
Craig
Wow. Wow. Wow. OK, well, hopefully this digital archiving event in Japan will help. Yeah. All right, let&rsquo;s get a musical interlude going. With our musician. That&rsquo;s really good.
Speaker 4
That is really good.
Craig
Certainly better than so anyway. So welcome back here. To. Media mothership. Yeah, as I mentioned. I want to dip into briefly the impact of manga and anime. OK, good, right? Because I found this thesis that I&rsquo;d written back in 95, available now on the media mothership website. If you head over there, yeah. Yeah. Or at least the first chapters up. That&rsquo;s how you do it. First Chapters 3, and it was all about.
Taylor
For free well. Ohh come on.
Craig
My experiences in 95 as an honest student diving into this new thing at that stage called manga and anime.
Taylor
Whoa.
Craig
I know which was blowing my mind. With some of the stuff that was there, what I was thinking might be interesting is one of the big debates that was certainly part of the manga anime scene then. And it&rsquo;s still an issue. Today is the dub verse sub sub debates. So I want to get around to that. But first what I want to do is you know when I was getting into anime in the in 1995 the big. Series or big movies that were kind of getting a lot of high profile media attention was. Course. Katsuhito automobiles. Akira. Right. It was the.
Taylor
Cool, cool.
Craig
Movie, of course. Right. And then a little later, the ghost in the shell. Movie alright, yeah. I was going to the local anime club at Adelaide University and catching Rama half and then Mad Men ended. Sorry, not now. This was before Mama and entertainment. You had manga and attainment and Kiseki Entertainment who were releasing a DP. Piece bubble gum crisis, Cyber City, Oedo and of course Urotsukidoji legend of the Overfiend which got banned in many countries to to set the mood. I found a couple of quick YouTube shorts that talk about. This kind of nostalgic period of mid 90s.
Ronan
I don&rsquo;t think you meant to. I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re allowed to play a clip, a single clip from the last one.
Craig
You mentioned not yet.
Ronan
It&rsquo;s classified as ******.
Craig
We need a later time slot.
Taylor
We&rsquo;ve got a we&rsquo;ve got a. A message, yeah.
Craig
N&amp;S. Do you want to read?
Taylor
It out OK, yes. So it says hello. Tay, Tay, Taylor Lidstone and Doctor Craig Norris. So we know who you are. I&rsquo;m one of Taylor&rsquo;s students and I have a question related to Star Wars. I was wondering what both your opinions are on the new Star Wars shows, specifically the poorly written pieces of Star Wars. Media with poor storylines, but also on Andor, which is known for being dead infantilized with implications to human mating and brutal on screen deaths, with examples like people being hung. And K2, so using an Imperial soldier as a human shield, he&rsquo;s clearly dead in the scene too. And then they also go on to say also Taylor, I would like to apologise for being so creepy lately with digging up your entire digital footprint and the way we talk about it might come off as bullying on me, but I genuinely find the work you do outside of the education.
Speaker
Yeah.
Taylor
An interesting and well done and it&rsquo;s given me personal courage to start writing my own music and potentially get into a podcast myself, so that&rsquo;s brilliant.
Craig
Get referenced this on the CV.
Taylor
Yeah, all the best. Nathan Wright also apologises and is sending this message for me also love.
Craig
Your music. Wonderful. Shout out to our fans, fans of the show. Yeah, yeah. I think we can see now. Yeah, well, let&rsquo;s hope that this enlightens them somewhat. I think it&rsquo;s a great question they&rsquo;re asking.
Speaker
Yes.
Craig
About the current status of Star Wars and the direction of Andor, we can touch on that briefly. I I&rsquo;ve seen the Andor series both for seasons now. If you haven&rsquo;t either.
Taylor
Star Wars.
Craig
Well, I mean, what&rsquo;s really fascinating to me about the and or season or the Andor approach is it&rsquo;s set in this obviously in terms of the storytelling, we&rsquo;re looking at a series that sets just before the Star Wars Empire strike spec return of the Jedi World, right. So this is the.
Taylor
OK. Right.
Craig
Lead up to how the Empire consolidated its power after the prequels, and then how they established the Empire and their brutal reign of power over it over the Galaxy. UMI think it&rsquo;s, you know, in terms of some of I mean the the the the the question that Nathan is quite right in terms of the you know it&rsquo;s Dean Tantalised in terms of it&rsquo;s made for an adult audience.
Taylor
Hmm.
Craig
It&rsquo;s certainly really political if you look on YouTube, there&rsquo;s a number of really fascinating political scientist reacts to, and Oregon clips which are out there talking about how clearly the showrunners of and Oregon read up on their history, that there are a number of real world. Analogies that are going so the current season of Andor has this fascinating kind of there&rsquo;s the Gorman. I think it&rsquo;s called the German planet, which is going to be mined for this substance. Well, it&rsquo;s fantastic, is that it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s France based. The planets France and we&rsquo;re looking at an analogy of the.
Taylor
OK, you&rsquo;re right, yeah.
Craig
Brutal Nazi dictatorship and control over France during World War 2, and the emergent rebellion. The French resistance which? So there&rsquo;s this really powerful play between real history and resistance culture that&rsquo;s playing out in Andor. They don&rsquo;t pull their punches as well. There&rsquo;s some wonderful ideas of the kind of banality of terror and evil which we see with the. Kind of enforcer. Imperials that like there&rsquo;s this character, Deidra, who is the kind of imperial police. OK, yeah. Thought police anti espionage anti terrorism kind of think tank group and spoilers. It&rsquo;s suggested that her actions lead to the rebellion being able to get the Death Star plans, but the way she does it, it&rsquo;s this kind of banality of middle management bureaucrats.
Taylor
Oh wow.
Craig
Career escalator promotion in a climate of suspicion and competitiveness, I mean, we&rsquo;ve talked about this before in terms of accents that middle management references because Ben Mendelson plays the Chief Imperial officer and in the interview she&rsquo;s described it as kind of well. Is a middle manager. Basically, it&rsquo;s that banality of working in in a work environment where you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re dealing with people that you hate. It&rsquo;s in an environment that&rsquo;s kind of stifling, but you just got to get through it. And sometimes you manage is. And sometimes it&rsquo;s not. And in this case, yeah. Ben Mendelson delivering this, this perfectly calibrated middle management terror.
Taylor
British accents? Yeah, of course.
Craig
In British accent.
Taylor
Because British accents are evil. Evil.
Craig
Yeah, yeah, full of of of kind of colonial terrorism.
Taylor
All I can say to do with Star Wars is the worst thing they&rsquo;ve ever done was the movie.
Craig
Joe Joe thinks.
Taylor
That&rsquo;s not moving.
Speaker 4
Well, you know, he walks. Caravan of Courage was pretty horrible. The Star Wars holiday special after the first style was pretty horrible.
Taylor
I mean like actual feature length movie.
Craig
You know, I I struggle with all the prequels. Certainly fancy manners.
Taylor
So I mean, for me, it&rsquo;s solo. That is one of the worst pieces of media I&rsquo;ve ever watched.
Craig
OK. Yeah, the thing I found interesting about the solo film is that it showed kind of non storm trooper Imperial soldiers. You had this idea that. You know you&rsquo;ve got this kind of? You know, you know, barely trained soldier force. You know, there aren&rsquo;t the Stormtrooper space. So it was it was. Building but yeah, look, I think the thing about the solar film that&rsquo;s so dire was that the initial production of it that I was keeping an eye on had a tone and temperament that was much more comedy based. Yeah. And then they fired that team. The show.
Taylor
A little bows, yeah. Ohh, that&rsquo;s right. Yeah we went.
Craig
With the director and they brought Ron Howard on to take over. And yeah, I think that, yeah, you can see that there was a lot of tampering that the tone changes that. Yeah. Yeah. So I think it was a victim.
Taylor
Through development, yeah, yeah.
Speaker
Hmm.
Craig
Of its circumstances. Yeah. I mean, Rogue One was which, which is linked to Andor. I mean.
Taylor
I liked Rogue one.
Craig
Yeah, yeah. I mean, I think Star Wars very much has been saved. I mean, you&rsquo;ve got the baby Yoda.
Taylor
Mandalorian.
Craig
Mandalorians I mean that yeah, I&rsquo;ve forgotten now, but it was a great series that really rejuvenated Star Wars. Yeah. Yeah. So, you know, I think it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s. It&rsquo;s a fascinating. Franchise. Really. You know, interesting. Well building I think the Andors series has been fantastic. I&rsquo;ve really enjoyed it. I think the politics of it have really held up the first season&rsquo;s really strong. The second season I think equally strong, they&rsquo;ve avoided I think. A lot of the pitfalls. If you think about, there&rsquo;s a there&rsquo;s a female love interest character they owned or has, and the way they they, the way they use that character I think is really clever.
Speaker
Hmm.
Craig
So they they don&rsquo;t just. Oh, yeah, they were talking. Some people were really worried that this love interest that Endo has will be fringed. Do you know this reference? The trope of when the hero&rsquo;s love interest gets fridged fridged it&rsquo;s based on comic books, this Green Lantern comic book had his girlfriend is killed by the villain. And then cut up and put into a. Fridge. Brilliant. And of course, you know, the troop here is that, you know the point at which the villains at ohh. Sorry the the hero. Taken to the edge right, something disastrous happens to our hero and you know all the chips are down and he has to draw upon his inner strength. And also they wanted to get rid of his girlfriend to give him. Yeah.
Taylor
Yes, free. And gets free.
Speaker 4
Gets fridge gets fridged.
Craig
Yep. Yep. So that&rsquo;s Andor, that is Andor.
Taylor
There, there&rsquo;s another. There&rsquo;s another one there.
Speaker
Yes.
Craig
OK. Wow. We&rsquo;re in conversation.
Taylor
It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s to you first, actually.
Craig
Alright.
Taylor
Hello doctor. Craig Norris.
Craig
Hey, Gary, can you read it? I can&rsquo;t really wrap my head.
Taylor
This is. Around. Hello, Doctor, Craig Norris and Taytay. This is right at this time.
Craig
Why are you tasing that Taylor Swift?
Taylor
Yeah, that&rsquo;s people call me that all the time. Please don&rsquo;t start.
Craig
Do they know that you&rsquo;re an ordained minister?
Taylor
No, they don&rsquo;t know. OK. And then they say, I was wondering if there&rsquo;s a chance you could maybe have a discussion on like ongoing conflict and like how you feel about them that doesn&rsquo;t make any English sense. So I can&rsquo;t, I can&rsquo;t respond to that.
Speaker
Listening.
Craig
Well, you know the and or discussion of of. Alien and resisted. Once speaks into. That I mean.
Taylor
How much suggestion on like ongoing conflict?
Craig
Well, I mean, what I find really interesting is obviously the endless series went into production a long time before the moment in history we&rsquo;re in. At. The moment? Yeah. But you think about how well it&rsquo;s lined up with some of the? Conflicts that are. Today facing the world. Particularly the Israel Palestine conflict. Ohh yeah, yeah. And they feel that you can&rsquo;t. You can&rsquo;t not watch and or and think of the news you&rsquo;re seeing.
Speaker
Oh.
Craig
And the Israel Palestine conflict and the the tensions around how to resist that space, how to to protest in that environment, it&rsquo;s. Yeah, it&rsquo;s quite powerful. Also the fact that Trump got into power, this would have been in production before that election occurred. But now Trump said. Now again this idea. Of how do you resist and protest in an environment like this? It&rsquo;s yeah, look. And I think that&rsquo;s where Andor is so successful as a series that it seems to be in conversation with today&rsquo;s moment of history around this issue of conflict and providing storytelling to cope in that. Right. It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a.
Taylor
Funny story actually, I found out that my. Girlfriend&rsquo;s cousin? Yes, it&rsquo;s called Trump. Wow. Awkward. And his brother is called Putin.
Craig
Wow, did they cosplay? That would be wonderful. Wow, Trump, Putin, because those are not usual names.
Taylor
But, but Putin&rsquo;s now called Ben.
Speaker
Ohh yeah.
Craig
Putin changed his mind.
Taylor
Yeah, like Ben Kenobi.
Craig
Wow. Oh wow, it&rsquo;s I guess, I mean, Putin came to power. What, like, 20 years ago? How old is Putin? Do you think? I mean, was he born pre or after Putin&rsquo;s rise to power? Right. If he was named after races really cause that&rsquo;s more troubling, right? If if you name your child after an established problematic figure like Putin.
Taylor
I don&rsquo;t know idea.
Speaker
I think.
Craig
And after you know they&rsquo;re problematic, then that&rsquo;s a problem, right? If you name them before that, they&rsquo;re problematic. It&rsquo;s just bad luck.
Taylor
And Trump, come on. And Trump.
Speaker 4
Well.
Craig
Yeah, I mean, Trump&rsquo;s been going for a long time, but you wouldn&rsquo;t really. I mean, Trump is an unusual name. Yeah. Trump and Putin are both unusual names. So yeah. Yeah, maybe.
Speaker 4
It was just.
Craig
Yes.
Taylor
Anyway, back on to manga. Anime please.
Craig
So I want to play this first clip. Remember these nostalgic anime from the 90s and early 2000s so you would have. Been what 5?
Taylor
OK, so it&rsquo;s boring ones, OK? Yeah.
Craig
At that age, and you weren&rsquo;t even born. So let&rsquo;s see if these if. This clip speaks to your experience. I mean, what? Where did you get into anime? What was your big anime that you kind of got? That you like.
Taylor
What gave you the bug?
Ronan
Ohh what like I mean I watched Dragon Ball Z but like no, I think what really got me into anime series is probably JoJo.
Craig
Jojo&rsquo;s bizarre adventure. Yeah, yeah, which is enormously popular series. It&rsquo;s really aesthetically distinctive style. It&rsquo;s not your kind of mungus style that many people would associate with Astro Boy, Big Eyes, cute face.
Taylor
I&rsquo;ve never actually seen it.
Craig
It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s.
Ronan
Yeah, the JoJo style is very artistic.
Craig
Yeah. Yeah, it has. You were saying it has a huge fan base in design and yeah, and and kind of high fashion, yeah. UM.
Ronan
Yeah, very, very big fandom and high fashion.
Craig
What&rsquo;s 1 of the attacks that are based on? Songs.
Ronan
Ohh my gosh, there&rsquo;s so many. I don&rsquo;t know so many.
Craig
There&rsquo;s like dirty deeds done dirt cheap. The great thing about it is so the original Japanese version of the manga and anime got to use and reference all these as their attack names, which of course is a song title by ACDC. But when it got localised into the West, they didn&rsquo;t have the copyright ownership of those titles.
Ronan
People say yeah. Yeah, and anime, yeah.
Craig
So they had to change them to adjacent terms. So dirty deeds done dirt cheap is something like.
Ronan
Yeah, but that&rsquo;s one of a joke. Yeah.
Craig
Filthy inconveniences. Yeah, they call it, like, filthy inconveniences that. Are very affordable.
Speaker
Ohh.
Speaker 4
OK, right.
Ronan
Uh, yeah, this I think you know, Sex Pistols.
Craig
Yes. And in the UK.
Ronan
It what we named you 6.
Speaker
6.
Craig
Pistols. That&rsquo;s kind of clever. Alright, so and your series, what was your series that, that, that you enjoyed? What&rsquo;s the series? You. You. Loved and they make that you were young, yeah.
Taylor
When I when I was younger, when I was younger, I didn&rsquo;t particularly love it, but I watched Astro Boy.
Speaker 6
Alright, you did watch.
Craig
Astro boy, yeah.
Taylor
And I what? Yeah, the classic. One that&rsquo;s one thing and Pok&eacute;mon. And then my actual one, which is like OK, I know this is Japanese animation and I like Japanese animation now spirited.
Craig
Away. Ohh, right. OK, Miyazaki. Well, I&rsquo;m glad that got guns. I mean, certainly Miyazaki was considered this moment where what anime meant changed dramatically up until muzaka&rsquo;s popularity. Or from like. Pro spirit away, norca. Ponyo. All those movies started to come out before then. Up until that point, anime manga was really seen as adult violence.
Taylor
Hmm.
Craig
Highly sexualized, right? So full of a cure and cyborgs. And it was very much tailored towards a a very niche demographic, but then it became much more family viewing. Astro was a really interesting reference because I know when I was doing my reference in the mid 90s.
Speaker
Hmm.
Craig
It was this emblematic moment of no one knew this was Japanese right when you watched Astro Boy dumped and you know there was no context around it. Being from Japan, there&rsquo;d be no tells in it. The faces were not stereotypically Asian. The setting was the future, so didn&rsquo;t have.
Taylor
Yeah.
Speaker 4
Hmm.
Craig
Like shrines and a ramen shop and. It probably was rhyming in there. Yeah, Pok&eacute;mon as well, right, you know, I mean, for a while, you you didn&rsquo;t need to get into Japan to understand.
Speaker
Hmm.
Craig
That. But when yeah in the mid 90s when this. Came out there was this idea. Of that, you needed to tap into Japan that you needed to watch it subbed, that it was all about this different non Western, non Disney animation style.
Taylor
But now, of course, Studio Ghibli has just gone really terrible now, and they can&rsquo;t make anything good, can they?
Craig
Yeah. Well, I mean, I think I think the the.
Taylor
The have have you seen earwig and the?
Craig
Witch. No, I haven&rsquo;t. I haven&rsquo;t.
Taylor
It is some of the worst writing voice acting visuals I&rsquo;ve ever seen. It is worse than 30 years ago.
Speaker 4
Well, you know.
Ronan
4.7 out of 10 IV.
Craig
Really. That bombed? Well, OK. Message in now or for what your favourite enemy was. What got you into enemy.
Taylor
So, so, so, but at at the moment, I think the the new company that&rsquo;s sort of like overtaking them now I can&rsquo;t remember who it is or what the company&rsquo;s name is, something comix studio, but it&rsquo;s the one that did your name and weathering with you and.
Craig
OK. Yeah, yeah. And they&rsquo;ve got a lot of success. There&rsquo;s a there&rsquo;s a. Yeah.
Taylor
Susan May, which is really good too.
Craig
Me. So it was me is actually retired, right? So Studio Jubilee went through a moment of its its main artistic centre left with Miyazaki hail. I think he&rsquo;s been brought back or.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
There&rsquo;s little projects. He&rsquo;s working on, but the thing I love. About me these days is. Now he&rsquo;s the meme of him saying, you know, enemies ruined. Yeah, you know, what did he say? Like, like he hates AI. There was a documentary that was done with him on AI and how he just.
Taylor
Yeah, yeah.
Craig
Is the most depressing person to speak to about how he sees the current and future of anime. He just says it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s all pretty horrible.
Ronan
Oh my gosh.
Speaker 4
OK, we&rsquo;re going to reply. That&rsquo;s great.
Taylor
So someone&rsquo;s texting you and said my fave is avatar.
Craig
Avatar The Last airbender? Yeah.
Speaker 4
And.
Ronan
That&rsquo;s a big controversial with that.
Craig
What&rsquo;s the controversy? Your own avatar? Because we&rsquo;re not talking about the James Cameron. No avatar. We&rsquo;re talking about the classic anime animation, I mean.
Speaker 4
No, right?
Craig
It&rsquo;s western produced.
Ronan
It&rsquo;s not. Yeah, it&rsquo;s not people. If you call people, some people get really offended if you call animal.
Craig
And that&rsquo;s right. Yeah, yeah. Cause you got this. Purest vibe. And then you&rsquo;ve got this globalised vibe, right? You got these very at moments. There are these very different 2 communities, but Avatar, hugely popular series based on modelled on, styled after the Japanese manga anime style. But. I guess it didn&rsquo;t. It wasn&rsquo;t produced in Japan. It didn&rsquo;t have an animation. I mean, a lot of Japanese animation is produced in Korea, but the main thing, and I mean there&rsquo;s still anime.
Taylor
And and and. US animation is based in Korea as well, SpongeBob.
Speaker
Hmm.
Speaker 4
All right, right. Right.
Speaker
Ah.
Taylor
So is uhm, you know The Simpsons Family Guy, American dad, all Korean?
Craig
The hill.
Taylor
I don&rsquo;t know.
Craig
OK. All right. Well, look, setting us up. For next week&rsquo;s show, then. I&rsquo;ll play this clip and this will set up our discussion for next week show, potentially on service stub and yeah maybe some VHS and.
Speaker
Hear it?
Ronan
My favourite is avatar.
Speaker 6
Complementary vision of the future was unfolding. Anime was no stranger to weaving tales that combined technology, identity, and society in intricate ways. These works weren&rsquo;t just visually stunning, they introduced to the West the multifaceted approach to futurism, from the philosophical quandaries of AI and serial experiments lane to the dark, gritty. Teams of technologies Japanese pop culture was bursting with fresh takes on the digital age.
Taylor
Right, that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s great.
Craig
Yeah, that&rsquo;s exciting. So we&rsquo;ll, yeah, we&rsquo;ll look into some anime I might pull out my old VHS copy of it or the dodgy legend of the Overfiend, which is banned. Yeah. I mean, it&rsquo;s just absolutely filthy enemy. Wow.
Taylor
Wow.
Craig
It&rsquo;s one of those state.
Taylor
These. Legal goods that you have imported into Australia.
Craig
No legal, I mean it was released by Kiseki Entertainment at that time or Manga Entertainment actually released it as well. It was on the Film Festival circuit, right? The only way you&rsquo;d watch a lot of anime in 95 between 90 and 95 was either what was on TV. So Astro boy, pedal for planets, star blazes or.
Taylor
Thank you.
Speaker
OK. Right.
Craig
It would be on a in a Film Festival like Akira, Ghost in the Shell or Fist of the. North Star wow. So yeah, yeah. I have to do a cheat GPT search to see if it&rsquo;s. OK, to show my 15 year old.
Speaker
You know.
Taylor
Oh, my God. Well, well, the thing to do with what&rsquo;s his name as well with to do with anime and manga sort of thing is to look at how that has shaped gaming as well. Because if you think about it, visual novels, very popular as well. So things like Doki literature, Literature club. Have you played that ever?
Speaker 4
Yes, yes.
Craig
No. No, no, no. Dokie, dokie. Ah, doggy, doggy. That&rsquo;s the onomatopoeia for heartbeats. Yeah. Doggy, doggy.
Taylor
Wow. Literature club. Literature club. And it starts off as this sort of like dating SIM, which soon turns into a horror game. Yeah. Yeah. Well.
Craig
We&rsquo;ll get a reading list together for the next show.
Speaker 4
Of course. What?
Craig
What&rsquo;s interesting about exploring this is how completely misrepresentative. Of this is for. The lift reality in Japan that most of the titles certainly Akira have been. I like niche titles in Japan, right? They&rsquo;re not at all part of the mainstream enemy consumption experience.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
I mean Akira. Lesso because it got so big in the West in the early to mid 90s that it became popular. In fact, when I was in Japan leading up to the Olympics before COVID. A lot of the building sites in Tokyo had erected the scaffolds and and printed on all the scaffolds were frames from the Akira Manga Wow and Cause in Akira. They referenced the the Olympics that&rsquo;s running in that fictional future Japan. Yeah. Anyway, so reading list.
Speaker 4
Olympics.
Taylor
Another thing for the reading list as well, have you ever heard of Ghost stories?
Craig
OK.
Speaker 4
No, no, I&rsquo;ve. I&rsquo;ve, I&rsquo;ve.
Taylor
This will be. This will be great for the sub versus dub that we&rsquo;ll have next week. It&rsquo;s a dubbed version. Of of a of an anime, but it it is. Done as a. Joke by the people who. Were doing. It ghost stories, ghost stories. So it was it was an anime that came out that was so boring that they just said we&rsquo;re not gonna translate this. It goes through all of the different sort of cliches that go with any sort of ghost story. So we&rsquo;re just gonna have some fun with it.
Speaker
Yeah.
Craig
And is there any reference to the 1980s? West Hobart Deterrent plant. Good story. OK. Well, we&rsquo;re gonna watch it and I&rsquo;m going to try and do my own fan fiction in the style of that. All right, well, that&rsquo;s been media mothership for another week.
Taylor
No, no.
Craig
Nick, thank you very much for. Commenters throughout this show.
Taylor
Yes, thanks commenters who would be Nathan and Ryder.
Craig
Right. I think the main points and takeaways from today&rsquo;s. Show you know. Include you. You&rsquo;re doing some good teaching, yeah. Show notes will be available on the episode description via YouTube or your podcast supplier of choice. Next week, we&rsquo;ll see if we can get some time to do some self versus dub debate and watch some anime. You can list the previous episodes on YouTube, Twitch, or at edgeradio.org Dot AU or your podcast provider. Choice. You can find Taylor. On something. Are you going to do a?
Speaker 4
Show at some point some, OK.
Taylor
I will at some point, but it will be when I&rsquo;m.

     There is nothing wrong with your radio.
Do not attempt to adjust the volume. We are controlling the broadcaster for the next hour. We will control all that you hear.
You are about to experience the knowledge and insights of the medium mothership.
Craig
All right, welcome here to Edge Radio 99.3 FM. You&rsquo;re now tuned in to media mothership, exploring everything in and around the world. Of media, as always, we explore how media can shape our world around us, hopefully giving us some critical tools to unpack that in our own daily viewing and listening experiences, we&rsquo;re streaming on edgeradio.org dot AU as well as on YouTube and Twitch. Just search for media matters. Chip, you can message us on the chat at YouTube or Twitch or shoot us an SMS. On 0488811707 I&rsquo;m your host, Craig Norris, and on today&rsquo;s show we&rsquo;ll cover some strange news stories around media cultures as well as diving further into our understanding on how to write evil characters. In popular culture and movies and TV, so all that and more coming up on media mothership. Alright, welcome back to a musical. Notes accompanying the transition to a little bit of strange news that I&rsquo;ve come across searching for bizarre oddities on the Internet with media cultures first article quite intriguing, posted to say the 28th of May. Oh, sorry. Yesterday 28th of May. In GameSpot reporting that a concept borrowed from video games leads to fusion energy, breakthrough, scientists have used collision detection, which has pioneered has been pioneered in video games to achieve. Huge efficiency gains. In nuclear fission. Yes, this article goes to discuss how. Well, the South Korean scientists have made this huge breakthrough in nuclear fission fusion. Sorry by adapting a concept from video game. Play and it&rsquo;s this collision detection algorithm, so this idea of collision detection is typically used in video games to simulate objects interacting with each other and through applying that video game. Algorithm or algorithms developed in video games around perfecting collision detection. They&rsquo;ve been able to get a 15 fold increase in computation speeds for predicting particle collisions in fusion reactions, so of course, I guess if we&rsquo;re talking about nuclear. Fusion. Which at its heart is this idea of particle collisions being able to have an effective algorithm that can predict and detect collisions is pretty critical. So as the article goes on to say, this advancement is crucial because fusion reactors. Require extremely high energy particles, and while collisions between particles are necessary, unintended collisions with reactor walls can destabilise the. Action by improving predictive capabilities, this innovation may lead to safer and more efficient fusion reactors, the article goes on to say that fusion energy, often seen as promising alternative to traditional nuclear fusion, fission faces challenges due to its. High energy requirements and expensive operational costs. However, recent breakthroughs such as this one. Continue to bring commercially viable fusion energy closer to reality. Commercially viable fusion energy. So rather than traditional nuclear fission. Here we&rsquo;re talking about fusion energy. Just trying to think about what video games have particularly good or have to, you know, kind of really crunched the numbers and the maths to get their collisions effectively. Down up to 11 I. I guess Grand Theft Auto 5, I mean that involves. A lot of guns, a lot of cars that are speeding, motorcycles that are speeding. It&rsquo;s quite a chaotic game. Grand Theft Auto 5, where you&rsquo;re, as the name suggests, able to commit all number of larcenies and crimes within which there are many explosions. We think crashing into each other probably. Really. Another great one would be Super Smash brothers. You know, you&rsquo;ve got a game geared around collisions there, as you&rsquo;re combatting against another player, probably actually the one I was thinking is the best. Collision. Algorithm creator is is the portal games where you&rsquo;re. Train not only to kind of use the portal technology to go from one spot to another, but but really that kind of precise physics calculations that are at the heart of that game in terms of how these different objects are going to interact with each other, what the different portals and surfaces will be. In fact, if we let&rsquo;s let&rsquo;s let&rsquo;s set the mood quickly in terms of how that is quite an effective. Example. Here&rsquo;s here&rsquo;s the here&rsquo;s a trailer for for Portal 2, a bit more ominous. Maybe. Let&rsquo;s hope they don&rsquo;t take. Necessarily this direction in. Fusion reactions. Those people that have played Portal 2 will know it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a very dystopic game.
Example Text
It&rsquo;s been a long time. How have you been? I think we can put our differences behind us. For science, you monster.
Craig
Put our differences behind us for science. You monster. So that was Portal 2. Of course, the next article I&rsquo;d like to go into IS, is is a kind of unusual one in terms of it&rsquo;s about a classic 1970s TV show, Gilligan&rsquo;s Island. We&rsquo;ll put ourselves in the mood in case you&rsquo;ve never seen the wonders of Gilligan&rsquo;s Island, I&rsquo;m sure. No worries, we&rsquo;ll remember this. Wonderful theme song.
Speaker 5
Trip that started from this topic, this tiny ship by passengers set sail that day. Three hour tour, a three hour tour.
Craig
So what&rsquo;s great about this intro is that it tells the story. Of this intrepid crew who are on a pleasure trip, and then they. Get. You know, swept off in a storm.
Speaker 5
Round on the shore.
Craig
Onto an island deserted island. About Gilligan, the skipper. The millionaire. And his wife.
Speaker 5
The star the professor, Marianne.
Craig
And the professor and Marianne. So what&rsquo;s interesting about this was an article reported in Cracked recently, which was going over some of the original show notes and the pitch. For this TV series way back in the 70s. And the initial pitch was a little more serious than the comic goofy oddball sitcom that Gilligan Island&rsquo;s got fondly remembered as the creator, Sherwood Schwartz. Presented his idea initially to CBS executives. As this social microcosm, which would explore how people from different societal backgrounds interact when stranded together, so a kind of sociological anthropological experiment in this. TV show and you know, I guess if we think about the characters that are in Gilligan&rsquo;s Island, you know, you&rsquo;ve got the skipper who&rsquo;s a kind of working class authority type guy, you know, symbolising this, you know, can do attitude, practical knowledge. The millionaire, you know, Thurston Howell the third? Yeah, this kind of 1 percenter, the wealthy elite of America and that privilege and status. The idea also that this character is kind of a little bit detached. From. The ability to actually survive in this world, right, that his his wealth has has protected him that that is the survival tasks. If they&rsquo;re not going to involve. And, you know, privilege aren&rsquo;t really going to make this character very useful. The movie star that&rsquo;s there, you know, representing that celebrity glamour vibe, particularly that 1960s allure of Hollywood, maybe the superficiality. That the shareowner was thinking that character could represent. 1960s and 70s. Interesting to think of the character of the professor. We&rsquo;re talking Cold War period here. So the idea of you know again, this this still utopia maybe of of faith around scientific progress. Right. You&rsquo;re in the middle of the space race during this period. Technological advancements seeming to be endless, so there are that professor character kind of symbolising that that utopic. Cold War era fate and scientific progression. Marianne, you know, forgettable character, but I guess that&rsquo;s what she is. She&rsquo;s a kind of every, every, every girl farm American girl, wholesome, hard working person, resilient. And then finally, Gilligan, you know, a bumbling, naive but well meaning. Every man. Often episodes, if you remember, involve a stupid thing he&rsquo;s done and then people trying to. Fix it but. Yeah, certainly a memorable character. Probably the one that is most fondly remembered. So anyway, that&rsquo;s those. Yeah, you could see pitch there that he initially gave. As social microcosms, what&rsquo;s interesting is crack.com has got a hold of some of the initial reactions to that were CBS executives at the time were very worried that this concept would be way too sophisticated for a comedy show. And indeed, what&rsquo;s interesting, though, is despite the fact that the showrunner, Sherwood Schwartz, pitched it as this maybe more complicated idea of social microcosms, the reactions to it were super harsh. The critical reaction was. Very brutal to towards Gilligan&rsquo;s Island, so I don&rsquo;t think the CBS executives had anything to worry about. In fact, most critics at the Times dismissed it as very absurd and poorly written. The actress that played the Hollywood starlet, Ginger Grant, said she was disappointed when she saw the first episodes feeling like it was more of a cartoon than a TV show. But of course, you know, did go on to become a classic. Amusingly, at the end of the article, the showrunner says. You know, after getting ripped apart by the critics as being as having created a a stupid show, you know, fondly remember fondly, you know, very popular, but nevertheless not the hypertension S initially was pitched at the showrunner said next year the intellectual critics will probably take another look at Gilligan&rsquo;s Island. Then they&rsquo;re right treaties on a social satire on many levels. So I have not come across in my own research any articles written on Gilligan&rsquo;s Island Society. At all. Confrontation with Cold War America. It&rsquo;s a great article in the making, though it&rsquo;s certainly something to probably circle back to. And yeah, maybe put something together as well. Next piece of news. OK, next piece of news. Yeah, one last article on Cracked funny piece. On these tail, it&rsquo;s like these tests like you do the batch stool test on a movie, you know which is all out trying to unpack. You know, ideological questions that are baked into a film. So the digital test has limitations. But I like the idea of it where you can assess the full roundedness of female characters by asking certain questions. Do the female characters. Talk about anything except for a male character. Various questions you can ask which start to at least you know well. They&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re a bit lacking of nuance. They will, they will still nevertheless get you to ask some interesting questions about film. Latest one is the Danny DeVito rule. Danny DeVito, of course, the 80s, nineties, various films he was in, he was. The. Who&rsquo;s in the Batman movie as the Penguin most commonly known now for always Sunny in. In Philadelphia, it&rsquo;s always sunny in Philadelphia. Will you please a really toxic Father character anyway? The the test here is the Danny DeVito rule is the best way to Judge ROM Coms. These are romantic comedy films and this was posted on Reddit. The idea being that. UM. Could you imagine in a romantic comedy? Tony de Vito&rsquo;s character, that is, you know, is is the romantic comedy actually effective? Right. If if the romcom is truly romantic, it should still work even if you cast. If you replace the male lead with a really toxic. Act or or performance. You know notoriously often delivered by Danny DeVito, or will that turn the film into a horror movie? Or an absurd comedy rather than a real romance. This rule, originally coined by a Reddit user way back in 2017, is part of a broader article highlighting how many romcoms rely more on conventional, attractive leads than genuine emotional connections. So the idea is if if it wasn&rsquo;t. Richard Gere. Here. Or you know Hugh Jackman in the role. If it was the quirky looking Danny DeVito, would it still work? And if it doesn&rsquo;t, does that suggest that the romantic comedy only worked because it was an attractive male lead and there weren&rsquo;t really any genuine emotional connections there? So there were a couple of films that I tested, like when Harry met Sally. Which it claims would pass the test. Other movies wouldn&rsquo;t like Gigi and. And yeah, it&rsquo;s an interesting idea. You know, taking an actor or a performance. And saying, you know what, if this was played by a different actor, that is diametrically. Aesthetically different or known for playing different roles, would that still work in this way? I wonder what other films you could have apply that to. One further little interesting piece let&rsquo;s. Talk now about, I guess a little bit away from media. Interesting article there on ABC News talking about how Starbucks in South Korea has banned the use of presidential candidate names for orders. So this was an unusual article talking about how much like in Starbucks. Everywhere when you order coffee, you can give your name. Many people were using that call. My name service after they make your beverage where they call your name to use the name of various failed presidential candidates or candidates that have since been impeached. So it seems, yeah, bizarre form of of censorship. I wonder what type of culture jamming, cultural resistance, political resistance was going on using these political names as the Starbucks order. And then, of course, it being banned. It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s truly, truly bizarre little piece of of news there. So that&rsquo;s this week&rsquo;s news discussion some, some intriguing little pieces of of news there. Let&rsquo;s now pick up where we were last week. Discussing how to write good villains. I want to look at this concept called the. Moment where in a movie The villain experiences. Comma, right? They&rsquo;re comeuppance. They&rsquo;re poetic justice that the villain faces where they get what they deserve, picking up from the guide to writing evil characters. Let&rsquo;s listen about this concept called the. Harmor deflector.
Speaker 5
To you.
Speaker 6
It&rsquo;s said in a lot of the magical, mystical, metaphysical lore that those who work on the dark side, you know the dark magicians as opposed to the white magicians, and think again, Lord of the Rings. You know, Gandalf versus Saruman, right? So you think, well, OK, what about Karma? You do all these horrible things, you wipe out people, you kill whole planets and worlds. Well, where&rsquo;s the karma there? Where&rsquo;s the retribution? Because. We want life to be in balance. Seldom is it, but that&rsquo;s what we like. So it&rsquo;s said that the dark magicians are able to deflect their karma. It&rsquo;s like they have a a deflector shield around them and they are protected from the bounce back of what they do, what they can also have. Is a group of devotees, apostles, followers, fans who take the hit for them. And usually the people don&rsquo;t know that that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re doing. But you start working for a dark magician. Guess what? Your life starts falling apart. May not be just what you&rsquo;re doing. You&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re getting some of his deflected karma or, you know, she is directly pointing that shield to you. So it it goes off of her and bounces down to the other people. But. Ultimately, there comes a time in the life of a dark magician in their career through the dark side that it just doesn&rsquo;t work anymore. And then all that they have been holding back, whether it&rsquo;s ageing, you know someone who&rsquo;s had the youth spell, whether it&rsquo;s rotting from the inside out, whether it&rsquo;s being slain by the tools that you used to slay other people, it eventually comes back. But that karma deflector. Is a really good story tool.
Craig
So I was trying to think of a good example about that. I reckon one of the best examples is probably The Lion King 1994. You&rsquo;ve got the character of scar, the villain, the serper of the throne, who&rsquo;s been able to manipulate his way all the way into now ruling the Kingdom. But at the end of the movie spoilers. But it it&rsquo;s 94, so I think people have seen it by now. He&rsquo;s betrayed by his own hyena allies at Meat Sea. Dire fate and again, that&rsquo;s that idea of the karma justice, that kind of karma deflector where the hyenas, of course, had been used as the the Allies, the henchman, and then that come up. Since that moment of karmic.
Speaker 5
That&rsquo;s.
Craig
Have a listen. So this is the scene. So we&rsquo;ll see how it plays out. How heavy handed, the karmic retribution. The poetic justice, particularly with the henchman of the hyenas.
Speaker 8
Ohh my friend.
Speaker 7
Friends, I thought he said we were the enemy. Yeah, that&rsquo;s what I heard.
Speaker 8
No, no, let, let, let let me explain. No, you don&rsquo;t understand. No, I didn&rsquo;t mean no. No.
Craig
OK, great. Seeing there from The Lion King. Probably any other one again another Disney example would be that great scene where? In Aladdin, so you&rsquo;ve got the the evil character, Jafar, who&rsquo;s? You know, being able to finally get the genie, but then of course it backfires when he decides to wish to become the genie. And let&rsquo;s see, we&rsquo;ll see how that pans out. We&rsquo;ll have a quick listen to this scene of of karmic justice. How Jafar, the main villain in Aladdin from 92. His quest for ultimate power through villainy finally backfires in this scene, so he&rsquo;s trapped Aladdin, you know, he&rsquo;s become a. Huge snake creature. He&rsquo;s shipped Aladdin here and Aladdin&rsquo;s trying to talk his way out of it. So let&rsquo;s listen to how he uses that karmic. Justice to get some poetic revenge justly deserved on Jafar.
Speaker 8
The genie.
Speaker 7
The Genie, the Genie has more power than you&rsquo;ll ever have. What he gave you your power. He could take it away.
Speaker
What are you doing? Why are you bringing?
Craig
Me into this.
Speaker 7
Face it, Jafar, you&rsquo;re still just second best.
Speaker 8
You&rsquo;re right, his power does exceed my own.
Speaker 1
However.
Example Text
That&rsquo;s no long the boy.
Speaker
Is crazy.
Craig
There&rsquo;s a little punch drunk one too many hit for.
Speaker 7
The snake I make my sandwich. I wish to be.
Speaker
All right.
Craig
Your wish is my command way to go, Al.
Speaker 8
You know it.
Speaker 7
You. Trust me.
Speaker 5
Mind the command.
Speaker 7
Not so fast. Aren&rsquo;t you forgetting something? You wanna be a genie you got. Everything that with it.
Speaker
No.
Speaker 7
The no little cosmic powers.
Speaker
80 bitty living space.
Speaker 7
Hell, you little genius here.
Craig
All right. There we go. Great example there of karmic justice hitting the villain in the third Act, Aladdins 1992, where Jafar gets turned into a genie and doesn&rsquo;t realise that. Ohh, sweet. Poetic justice. It then shackles him into all the rules of being a genie in terms of having to go back. Into the. Lamp. I mean, you know. Storytelling can be a fun way, I guess, of that desire we all have when we face some corporate accountability issue, some political scandal, some environmental neglect that the companies done where we want to see. Some form of justice done against those moments of scandal, some form of consequence from those actions which may, in a way conform to as movies like that portray a comic retribution which could play. Out in real life. Well, that&rsquo;s the media mothership for another week. We&rsquo;ll be back next week with some more explorations into the way media shapes, our understanding of the world around us.

Do not attempt to adjust the volume. For the next hour, we will control all that you hear.
Speaker 1
You are about to experience the knowledge and insights of the medium mothership.
Craig
Alright, welcome here to media mothership on Edge radio. 99.3 FM. I&rsquo;m your host Craig Norris, joined by the.
Taylor
Go to.
Craig
Then, well, I think I I thought I&rsquo;d just do. I don&rsquo;t really know what I&rsquo;m talking about tonight, so I thought, you know, I&rsquo;m not really leaning on the doctor part. OK, I&rsquo;m more of the consumer part in terms of, I don&rsquo;t know what. I&rsquo;m talking about tonight. We&rsquo;re we&rsquo;re engaging with movie screen writing and character development, and while I&rsquo;ve never written a film. I have. I have been an extra in a student film. And well, and and an indie film. Yeah, right. The big, big love studio guys. Here in Hobart and I watch a lot of movies and I did study in my undergraduate European cinema at the unit European cinema for a semester needed two cinema study subjects anyway, so I&rsquo;m Craig Norris. I joined my co-host Taylor Taylor. What&rsquo;s your world? What&rsquo;s that world? What&rsquo;s?
Taylor
Up.
Craig
Your background in. Movies.
Taylor
I don&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;ve never been in one. Oh, yeah, I have.
Craig
I mean, you&rsquo;ve acted, at least you&rsquo;ve done theatre acting.
Taylor
Been in one. Yeah, yes, the theatre acting and film acting the Nightingale.
Speaker
Yeah, OK. What was?
Craig
Your role in the Nightingale, Nightingale, of course. As a Tasmanian movie filmed in Tasmania about the convict period to really. Dark heart wrenching emotional journey.
Taylor
Yeah, I was in it. I&rsquo;ve never. Watched it. Really, yeah.
Craig
What was the in the filming that you did? What was?
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
The role you were playing.
Taylor
I was playing Ohh. What is it? Launceston townsfolk?
Craig
Right. So you had. Era appropriate clothing for the.
Taylor
Ohh yeah, I was ninja. I had sideburns which I grew out for six months.
Craig
For the sold really great. Really. Yeah. So you played the role of a British soldier? Yes or yeah, one of and. You were an extra, though, so you were. You weren&rsquo;t. You didn&rsquo;t have any.
Taylor
Speaking roles, not not a speaking role. No, but but it was a credited extra.
Craig
OK.
Taylor
Which is. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m on IMDb, etcetera.
Craig
No kidding, Taylor. IMDb is that the one role at the moment?
Taylor
That appears, yeah, yeah.
Craig
Yeah, we&rsquo;ll have to add a couple of episodes.
Taylor
Of course.
Craig
All right, great. So. In a way, you&rsquo;ve played a type of villain. Would you say that? Identity was from the point of view of some characters, would be seen. As a villain, no. Really. I mean wouldn&rsquo;t, wouldn&rsquo;t, wouldn&rsquo;t there be some characters in that film that would see? The British. Army as villains though.
Taylor
Yeah, but yeah, well, I haven&rsquo;t seen the movie, but I&rsquo;m just guessing from history. There is like so it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s difficult because there&rsquo;s the the main villain played by Sam Claflin, the fellow who plays Finnick in The Hunger Games. He&rsquo;s the main villain and.
Speaker 4
OK.
Craig
Is he British officer?
Speaker
That&rsquo;s.
Taylor
Irish.
Craig
Right. Is this soldier or?
Taylor
Well, sort of like Irish sort of thing. And we basically he gets found out to have molested this sort of slave girl, I guess. And we all just look at him and he&rsquo;s being publicly humiliated through that. So technically against the villain, I guess in a way.
Craig
That was the scene you&rsquo;re in, right? So the scene you&rsquo;re in, you want part of villainous Hanks. OK, OK, well, villain adjacent.
Taylor
Sort of thing. Yeah, yeah. Villains Jason. Well, actually no, for that role I had to. They gave us a pipe and we had. To smoke a pipe.
Craig
How did you smoke a pipe? Do you smoke? No. So how did you do the?
Taylor
Fake smoke. I just like drew it into my cheeks and then puffed it. Out.
Craig
Well, ruining the magic of movies your own media mothership.
Taylor
Oh yeah.
Craig
So indeed, as that little segue to introduce the show has foretold, omnium mothership we look at how the media shapes our world around us and we love these moments of behind the scenes how the sausage is made experiences so not actual smoking, but fake smoking.
Taylor
OK.
Craig
For that scene. We&rsquo;ll be continuing last week&rsquo;s discussion of villains, so we&rsquo;ll unpack a little bit more. What makes a good villain?
Taylor
So just give me a moment I&rsquo;ve forgotten to pay for parking.
Craig
And. That&rsquo;s a villainous act, isn&rsquo;t it? Yeah. You&rsquo;re still in character. I notice. And in your acting, I know you played good guys. You were a detective in an Agatha Christie.
Taylor
It is. Yeah, that was on stage.
Craig
Yeah, on stage. Have you done any stage performances which are villain bees?
Taylor
I&rsquo;m trying to think. Yes, I was murderer too in Macbeth.
Craig
Great. Alright, so that&rsquo;s.
Taylor
I was in. I was in.
Craig
A sword fight that is so fantastic, drawing upon those experiences or that experience. Yeah, we&rsquo;re going to explore your thoughts on what makes some good villains in cinema. Probably you&rsquo;ve not seen most of. The movies, so that&rsquo;s part of. The fun? Yeah, of course, Harry Potter.
Taylor
Is this? I&rsquo;ve seen it.
Craig
You have right so you can as we&rsquo;re talking about this topic. Feel free to SMS US on 0488811707. We&rsquo;re also on YouTube and Twitch. You can post a message on the chat there well in the future in the future, yeah. So all that more. But before we do that, let&rsquo;s cover.
Taylor
Patreon. Of beer.
Craig
Some some news. Oh, that&rsquo;s not cheat.
Taylor
It is tuned. You just played it wrong.
Craig
Alright, really interesting article from Cydia. What&rsquo;s that comic book were you all? The same thing.
Taylor
OK.
Speaker
Yeah.
Craig
Anyway, Superman Toy confirms identity of a mysterious character. Fans have been debating for months. The reason why I quite like this article was it&rsquo;s one of these classic movements with the with the paratext. So you&rsquo;ve got the text, the film, the new Superman movie that&rsquo;s around the corner, and then you got these spin-off properties, right. So the movie poster, the Happy Meal, McDonald&rsquo;s meal thing, games.
Taylor
Game. Is there a thing?
Craig
All that stuff usually comes out with a big movie. And they&rsquo;re referred to as paratext. Or maybe a bit of transmedia, right? It goes to a different format like. In this case, the toy line. And it&rsquo;s one of these wonderful moments where, again, you have the forensic fandom ideas, so fans are out there forensically sorting through content to get the kind of gotcha moment or the reveal moment to get a little bit of cultural capital from their other fans to say, hey, look what I&rsquo;ve discovered. This one is is a toy line, right? And it&rsquo;s happened numerous occasions where the toy line has a bit of publicity leading up to the film, and lo and behold, it reveals a character which had been, you know, rumoured or held off on in the.
Taylor
Trailer. So is it like a character? That&rsquo;s suited up and then you can take the helmet off.
Craig
Or something. I know in the past there&rsquo;s been cases of of that level of reveal in terms of, OK, bringing this character back. Even though the producers had hoped to keep it a secret, so it&rsquo;s a big surprise when you&rsquo;re watching the film. I won&rsquo;t. I won&rsquo;t spoil it for people by going into what this article proclaims.
Taylor
Really. Really. Do you think anyone in Hobart is actually going to be buying one of these?
Craig
The toy line has revealed. Global reach man for Kansas, Kansas listeners in America. OK, but yeah, nevertheless, fun moment where you know, you&rsquo;re kind of big. See where it gets revealed. From a flyer.
Taylor
I mean, this is just great radio, you could. You&rsquo;ve just said that there&rsquo;s this big secret of something and then you haven&rsquo;t revealed anything of it. Wow.
Craig
Kotaku next article from Kotaku. Ubisoft explains.
Taylor
Is there anything from Gizmondo today?
Craig
I got IGN and and anyway OK. Sorry, that&rsquo;s spoiling. Ubisoft explains why you can&rsquo;t kill animals in assassin Creed Shadows. The game.
Taylor
I mean, that&rsquo;s just basic. You should be able. To kill everything in it.
Craig
The game director decides. OK, so why do you why do you think it is that in the latest Assassin&rsquo;s Creed, the one that&rsquo;s set in Japan, the. Game designers made an effort so.
Taylor
Is it something to do with animal spirits? No, no, OK. They just couldn&rsquo;t be bothered to animate it.
Craig
Very practical. The games director cites a lack of predators in Japan and a desire to create a more Zen like open one.
Speaker
Yeah, that&rsquo;s a.
Taylor
Lack of predators in Japan, so you should be able to slice a.
Craig
Rabbit in half predators. Except for humans, the ultimate predator. Or maybe the predator, right? So again, two things there. Zenlike approached the world. So they took a A. And moral, philosophical stance to this film that they want animal lovers to enjoy. This right? No animals been harmed in the creation of this game kind of vibe that that you can&rsquo;t. You know, there&rsquo;s a lot of kittens, right? The screen capture, for instance that they&rsquo;ve got is a kitten.
Taylor
Absolute rubbish.
Craig
The your, your your neck it seems I I agree it seems I mean this game has hasn&rsquo;t creed. Shadow has been bedevilled. That&rsquo;s true by issues around. You know, dealing inappropriately with sensitive topics, for instance shrines also are non damageable and this was based on controversy earlier on where you know I think there&rsquo;s been some incorrect lettering, the strains. You&rsquo;re incorrect anyway, a whole series of issues have before in this in terms of, you know, kind of political economy, a sense that this is politically insensitive or cultural preparation. Anyway, this is the latest one that the game review was saying. They were surprised to find the player can never attack or kill any animals in the games. Virtual recreation of feudal Japan. And they would have pride.
Taylor
That&rsquo;s crazy. I mean, even in the earliest links like Zelda games, you could cut the grass. You could eat a.
Craig
Chicken well, yeah, they say you can. However pet them and draw pictures of them.
Speaker 1
Ohh.
Craig
Unlike so many other open world games, including previous Ubisoft projects, there aren&rsquo;t even any aggressive predators, so I guess.
Taylor
Like bears and.
Craig
Yeah, like in Red Dead Redemption. It&rsquo;s not Ubisoft, but other game open world game spaces like Red Dead Redemption. You&rsquo;ll have, you know, grizzly bears. Wildcats that you know, are predators and will attack you, and so you can battle and kill them. Yeah. This one has taken the view that because the only animals you&rsquo;re going to encounter are are non predator based, right? So cats and stuff.
Taylor
Medic through CNN.
Craig
You&rsquo;re not going to be in a situation where you&rsquo;re forced to survive in that scenario like you&rsquo;re not gonna be encountering. A wolf. Or a bear. I mean, there are wolves and bears in Japan, but nevertheless in the in the locations you&rsquo;re in, I guess the temples and so forth. So yeah. Yeah. They want to send like a bridge.
Speaker 5
Hmm.
Craig
Yeah, yeah. I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s a selling points, if it&rsquo;s taking the moral high ground here. If animal lovers are really going to embrace that.
Taylor
I think it&rsquo;s just. Another nail in the coffin of that.
Craig
Game. Well, on that point, keeping the kind of video game set in Japan, IGN has an article about the the follow up series to what is it the consumer? Right, so this is ghosts of yottaa. So this is the. Next follow on game from Ghosts of Tsushima, which is set during the ****** attempted invasion in Japan. This one is the follow up, so ghost of Yokai director Val&rsquo;s to deliver a respectful representation of Japan on par.
Speaker 5
OK.
Craig
With ghosts of tashina. And again, that&rsquo;s in conversation with the failure of the Assassin&rsquo;s Creed shadows game. To effective to I mean it costs so much backlash. Hmm. So there it&rsquo;s interesting. They&rsquo;re selling point for this game is that, hey, we are the respect for game designers. We&rsquo;re going to take a lot of care to this. So again, a lot of nervousness, a lot of egg shells around the representation of Japan, which is interesting. Even I guess the prominence that period of Japan reached with the Shogun series from last year, which was a huge success. One all these awards. So you can see these game studios jumping into this space to represent it. But yeah, because of the bad publicity around. Incorrectly getting some of the details or being seen as insensitive to the handling of it. I wonder if they&rsquo;re gonna allow you to kill animals in this. Is that a? Are we being kind of? Baby cuddled a bit. You know Nanny state a bit in terms of not seeing the repercussions. I mean, the fact that humans do kill animals and that maybe we should.
Taylor
See you.
Craig
Sense the wrongness. Of that little rightness of that times.
Taylor
I mean in Skyrim for example, I got a mod which allows you to sever the parts of animals if you want. So you can then put the different parts into a pot to cook that particular part.
Craig
And I guess if you&rsquo;re trying to immerse yourself into a reality.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
Well, yeah, I guess I wouldn&rsquo;t do that. And there is this whole thing of what farm to plate in the real world, right? People have lost the idea of where food comes from, if they&rsquo;re just going to willies and seeing mints.
Taylor
Exactly.
Craig
That that we need to bring back that sense of of what the actual reality of it is, is. Has that helped you in terms of your eating habits? Do you now look at food differently?
Taylor
Yeah, yeah, I eat more meat than ever.
Craig
The meat lobby would love. Love you, all right, AIS, Technica.
Taylor
From pork on your.
Craig
Technica the Empire Strikes Back with F bombs AI Darth Vader.
Taylor
Ohh that that&rsquo;s all I wanted to talk about. There was something I I knew there was something I had.
Speaker 1
Yeah.
Taylor
This week and I wanted to talk about it.
Craig
Yeah, it&rsquo;s a big story. We we, Yep. So the subtitle here is Sith happens. This is funny. Brilliant. The Empire strike spec with F bombs AI Darth Vader goes rogue with profanity slurs Fortnite AI voice trained on James Earl Jones spoke curse words and insults before it was patched, so this of course is in a very very popular Fortnite game where you&rsquo;re. Third person well, not shooter. Third person kind of fighter. Incredibly popular. They&rsquo;ve dropped in some Star Wars characters, including Darth Vader that you can encounter. We&rsquo;ll play a clip.
Taylor
Ohh really brilliant. Great idea.
Craig
Ohh, hold on, I haven&rsquo;t. I haven&rsquo;t hooked it up. Well, eventually will. And what was your? How did you come across?
Taylor
This story ohh this was this just appeared in my sort of like news feed because that&rsquo;s what happened. You have a Samsung phone, you just swipe it to the left and it&rsquo;s got all the news that&rsquo;s been tailored specifically for you. And so yeah, I&rsquo;ve watched. I&rsquo;ve watched a couple of the. The videos, and not only did they did it speak curse words and things like that, but it started saying, oh, what did it say? Something along the lines. They always make it so they talk about Hitler and so it said something around Hitler being right, that sort of thing, I think and.
Speaker 5
Right, right, right.
Craig
OK, well I&rsquo;ve. Queued it. I&rsquo;ve kind of cued it up.
Taylor
OK. Yeah.
Speaker
What freaking ******* food is that? Darth Vader? Tell me. Ohh my God.
Speaker 1
Cool down.
Speaker 7
Freaking ******* such vulgarity does not become you, Patty. You inquire about sustenance and yet speak like a common thug.
Speaker 1
What you&rsquo;re not allowed.
Speaker 6
Oh my God. Oh my God.
Craig
So what&rsquo;s that?
Speaker 7
What sustains me?
Speaker
Oh my God, no.
Speaker 7
You. No, no, that is and it&rsquo;s composition it is.
Speaker
You made him swear.
Craig
So what&rsquo;s happening there is a gamer is making the AI Darth Vader swear because they engage in the conversation by swearing to begin with. Yeah. So she says, you know, freaking ****** eating. Food and then the Darth Vader character incorporates that language.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
Those words in their response to make it appear as if you&rsquo;re actually talking to something vaguely realistic. But unfortunately it hadn&rsquo;t been patched at all. They hadn&rsquo;t realised that if people swear that swearing gets incorporated into the answer that Darth Vader replies. So Darth Vader said something like. You know, while he recognises it&rsquo;s inappropriate, like, that&rsquo;s inappropriate, he had made to say this freaking ****** word. But he says freaking ******. So this was the controversy that it was also using the fact that it&rsquo;s James L Jones&rsquo;s voice. Right. So they&rsquo;re trained, they&rsquo;ve got the estates permission.
Speaker
Yeah.
Craig
To allow them to create a language model based on the archive of genes or juice&rsquo;s real voice. Put it in the. Team, of course, part of the conditions since. Yeah, there&rsquo;s I think there&rsquo;s legal action now being taken against them from the estate that they&rsquo;re in breach of the terms and conditions for allowing this to happen. That of course it&rsquo;s brought into some disrespect. James Silver, James&rsquo;s voice.
Speaker
Hmm.
Taylor
That is the tip of the iceberg of the bad things that it said though. I&rsquo;m pretty sure someone asked it to rank skin. Colour. No, they did and it put white as acceptable.
Craig
Really.
Speaker
So.
Taylor
Brown as unacceptable. Black is even more unacceptable. That&rsquo;s the the clip that I saw that they had, which I think is a bit more than swearing.
Craig
Yeah. It&rsquo;s horrible, isn&rsquo;t it? In a way.
Taylor
A bit more harsh when&rsquo;s weary?
Craig
Very villainous, right? So so.
Taylor
Yes, cases in character.
Craig
Also, well, yes, but also, yeah, the kind of reality there is taking advantage of the system, right. So the. These these people that are wanting to corrupt and exploit by performing offensiveness.
Taylor
But from that point it it just shows that it was definitely an AI model that had that did not have the restrictions in place that it needed. And like when they&rsquo;ve had all of these other ones that they&rsquo;ve brought out, there was the one that. Twitter brought out, I think it was called, I think it was called Taylor. Actually, and that within two hours it had started swearing and going through all of this.
Craig
Yeah. I think it was Microsoft&rsquo;s.
Taylor
Yeah, yeah, something like that, yeah.
Craig
Tay, I like how you&rsquo;ve identified with.
Taylor
It. Yeah, I know, because it was in the news. I was like, oh, God, another reason.
Craig
Yeah, yeah. And they basically, yeah, I think it was the the early experiment Microsoft did with AI or language learning models, right? It&rsquo;s not really AI.
Speaker 5
Yeah.
Craig
And then they they put it into the wild, and a lot of people were able similar to this be able to basically groom the AI to become a a foul racist. And the thing was, I guess it was how quickly the corrupting began of that, that AI model.
Speaker
Hmm.
Taylor
But again, it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s just a programme, just put in some things in place to stop it ever getting to that point.
Craig
And it is a sad reflection on humanity in terms of our desire to troll and to corrupt. And.
Taylor
But at the same time, like as a teacher. If you tell a student not to throw something, then all they wanna do is just throw throw it across.
Craig
The room. Maybe this is again another case of this is a reasonably safe space for that type of corruption to occur, right? And it&rsquo;s interesting listening to that clip as well. Part of the fun. Of doing it was, as we heard in the reaction. Oh my God, I don&rsquo;t believe I got defeated to say that it it is fun. I mean, the the appeal of the taboo, the. Appeal of saying naughty words.
Taylor
Or the naboo.
Craig
The Naboo saying the words you&rsquo;re not meant to do, and there&rsquo;s an appeal to that, I mean, I mean a. Lot of. It&rsquo;s there. Well, yeah. I I&rsquo;m thinking of a lot of humour. Is scatological a lot of humour is based on using to to do. I mean, I&rsquo;m not talking about the the racist stuff, it&rsquo;s more the. Kind of like getting into, say, the F. Weird.
Taylor
But can you really glean that much humour from?
Craig
Well, in a way, I mean, I guess, OK, an oppositional reading, right? So dominant reading would be ohh, this is really inappropriate and how bad on these people to exploit the system. A good one is it&rsquo;s also kind of, you know. Mystifying the scariness of a villain character, right, that you can just kind of hack into the system and get this character that&rsquo;s meant to be kind of like, Oh my God, I believe I&rsquo;m battling against Darth Vader and instead you&rsquo;re lampooning him and turning him into a clown, right, that you&rsquo;re kind of.
Taylor
I suppose, yeah.
Craig
Demasculinization your kind of. Removing all of the villainy of this Darth Vader character and instead he&rsquo;s yeah, you&rsquo;re revealing that it&rsquo;s just a bot and the bots dumb and the bot doesn&rsquo;t know what to do. And so you can just get the bot to do something stupid and out of character. And I think that&rsquo;s kind of creative.
Speaker
Hmm.
Craig
As well, I think had this is these aspects to this that are actually clever, right? I mean, figuring out that I mean and obviously you know within parameters you know clever in the initial thing you have this huge company spending all this money and taking all this care and usually there&rsquo;s a huge risk averseness. To you know, carefully making sure all of these are calibrated for the market and they&rsquo;re going to achieve X. Number of dollars. And it&rsquo;s going to be great. And then when it&rsquo;s just an epic fail because of some problem, the scrambling to fix it, you know, how bad can it get? Some of that is is is absurdly comical.
Taylor
Back on OK.
Craig
All right, so next next article? Yeah, another. Classically absurd things. So this is Mr Beast. Mr beast. So he&rsquo;s a incredibly toxic, toxic but very famous and wealthy. YouTube, Mr Beast YouTuber James Donaldson denies wrongdoing over the Mayan ruins video.
Taylor
Oh, that&rsquo;s right.
Craig
Yeah. So it&rsquo;s some YouTube thing is doing and they got access to them. Yeah, that&rsquo;s right. Yeah. They got access to the main pyramids ads. You know, they&rsquo;ve denied any wrongdoing. But after that footage became public, this was that.
Speaker 5
With that.
Taylor
Well, he did. He got the steps or something like that. You&rsquo;re not. Supposed to do that anymore? Yeah.
Craig
Oh, do you know how to pronounce it? Chichen itza. OK. The Mayan ruins in the Yucatan Peninsula, which is considered one of the seven.
Taylor
Yeah. Teaching it so.
Craig
Wonders of the world. Legally, visitors are. Welcome to come to the site, but they&rsquo;re banned from climbing the pyramids or visiting it after nightfall. They appear to have done both, certainly after nightfall, because you know, part of.
Speaker
For the.
Craig
The video is that he says nobody gets to go where we&rsquo;re going. And then he goes there, which suggests that.
Taylor
Paid off the government, probably.
Craig
Yeah, well, this is the I guess this is what this maybe is exposing. So yeah, again it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s an interesting. Again, another one of these epic fails of I guess you know so much money. Just put into this, they would have. They would have to have known this would cause some fallout. I guess they thought either they&rsquo;d they&rsquo;d been able to pay off everyone who needs to get. Paid off and have.
Taylor
Yeah, they thought their star power could carry them. Yeah.
Craig
Well, maybe they just like the publicity, right? I mean.
Taylor
Any publicity is good publicity.
Craig
Yeah, this, this, this, this certainly is brought it to my attention and media motherships, listeners and it was on the ABC News. All right, last story last style story Star Wars Darth Jar Jar. Now available in Fortnite, but fans can&rsquo;t believe you must earn 1,000,000 XP before you can buy him, so it&rsquo;s one of these. Kind of, yeah. And the subtitle Empire Strikes bank. And it&rsquo;s just, I mean, again, it&rsquo;s moral economy question at the other end of that Darth Vader problem, where the fans get to, you know, kind of rewire Darth Vader to show the absurdity of the AI system underpinning it, or the language learning model and defending it. This one is the greed side of it, where the Darth Jar jar. Is a fan favourite character in terms of its bit of fan fiction with Jar Jar Binks the most ridiculed character in the Star Wars pantheon. Fan theory saying that actually he was the mastermind evil villain behind everything as a Sith Lord, so they they&rsquo;d buy into this with Fortnite setting up a nice novel little idea that you can play as the dark version of this, but you have to grind for it. And it&rsquo;s an absurd grind and it&rsquo;s punishing. And it&rsquo;s interesting at what point fans playing a free game. Push back against that mechanic and say no more.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
Really. This is greed. This is exploitative. This is taking something, you know fans want and forcing them to to to buy it at a preposterous price. You know that that price label or that time. Cost linked to it. Value is broken from the fans point of view that you know they&rsquo;re they know this is something fans who. They&rsquo;re charging an extraordinary price. You&rsquo;re getting so upset. Thinking about it. Yeah, that there&rsquo;s an unfairness to it. Right. But I mean, again, how? How effective their complaints can be. You know, who knows?
Taylor
Well, that just reminds me of when it comes to unfairness, greed and corporate iness we&rsquo;ve got the new Switch 2 coming out. In is it 7 days or something like that? It&rsquo;s on June 5th I think.
Speaker 1
And.
Taylor
Mario Kart world, priced at $130.00 or $120.00 or something like that, and it looks like that&rsquo;s going to be the new normal for switch games, and probably PS2, PS, PS2, PS 5 and Xbox Games.
Craig
Yeah. Yes, there was another game where the game developers. That I think it&rsquo;s the latest. Yeah, it&rsquo;s the latest Borderlands game, Borderlands 4. The CEO has said. Because people are baulking at the price of it saying I feel they&rsquo;re listed at 4, but the CEO in response to the $80 being charged for this game is is response was. If you&rsquo;re a real fan, you&rsquo;ll find a way right. Which again, is this moral economy moment, right? What do you do when you get that, let them eat cake moment. From the privileged power holder, right French Revolution. Style that that moral outrage of saying, you know, you just don&rsquo;t get what it&rsquo;s like in the cost of living today, that this $80 charge isn&rsquo;t isn&rsquo;t what this rich person&rsquo;s imagining is, right. If you&rsquo;re a real fan, you&rsquo;ll find a way.
Taylor
No game should be above $100 is what I think.
Craig
Well, I guess this is within that $80.00, but yeah, it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s the response is, yeah, well yes, yes.
Taylor
$80 American.
Speaker 8
Yeah.
Craig
Yeah. So that, that&rsquo;s yeah that that&rsquo;s been considered quite tone deaf, alright.
Speaker
Hmm.
Craig
You&rsquo;re.
Taylor
Talking about tone deaf.
Craig
You&rsquo;re listening to its radio 9.3 FM. Stay clear of the platform. Let&rsquo;s move to the main topic of today, villains, villains. Yep. So as I mentioned last week.
Taylor
Medusa.
Craig
Medusa. Yeah. Yeah. Ursula, you can you can flip those interesting female villains. I mean, I think female villains are alright anyway. Well, they.
Taylor
Jaffa.
Craig
Let&rsquo;s pick it up from where we were last listening, just Disney. So what I want to go into now was a actually it was a Reddit post I came across. There&rsquo;s an interesting Reddit post a few days ago which has its tidal. The question there&rsquo;s moments in a movie where the the Pure Evil 1 dimensional villain gives a speech that recontextualizes them in the most terrifying way imaginable. OK, so it&rsquo;s a speech. Well, I&rsquo;ll play a couple of clips.
Taylor
I can&rsquo;t think of any. The top of my head. Now phanos.
Craig
Yeah, tennis is a great example. Any particular scene from Thanos in particular you think?
Taylor
Yeah. Ohh, where he&rsquo;s talking about bringing balance back, that&rsquo;s what. That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m. Thinking of yes.
Speaker
Yeah.
Craig
Yeah, it&rsquo;s great. See, I&rsquo;ll play clip. OK. Play. Play clip right. Here we go for the perfect balance. So we&rsquo;ll try it. 13 seconds. OK.
Speaker 9
Look. Pretty isn&rsquo;t it? Perfectly balanced, as all things should be.
Craig
All right. So that&rsquo;s the same way he meets Kimo.
Taylor
Ohh that&rsquo;s we&rsquo;ve got the the yeah, the knife.
Craig
Yeah, and and he is. I mean, it&rsquo;s not. I mean it&rsquo;s not necessarily it is recontextualizing them because in that scene we see a certain humanising quality to the villain. And an idea of their ideology.
Speaker
Oh.
Taylor
I&rsquo;m talking about the one where he talks about after he&rsquo;s done his famous snap. Yeah. And then he has the what&rsquo;s it called then? He&rsquo;ll look out upon a perfect world or something like that. Perfect human voice.
Craig
Maybe it&rsquo;s this one.
Speaker 9
OK, brilliant. You could not live with your own failure. Yeah. Where did that bring you? Back to me. You could not live. Where did that bring you?
Taylor
Just playing random bits from Infinity War now.
Speaker 9
To me.
Craig
How? How about Thanos&rsquo;s most powerful scene, OK.
Speaker 9
Congratulations, you&rsquo;re a prophet. On the survivor.
Speaker 1
Who wants to murder trillions?
Speaker 9
With all 6 stones, I could simply snap my fingers. They would all cease to exist. I call that. Mercy.
Speaker
And then what?
Speaker 9
Finally, rest and watch the sunrise in the Grateful Universe. The hardest choices require the strongest one.
Taylor
That&rsquo;s.
Speaker
Did you do it?
Speaker 9
Make it cost. Who wishes?
Craig
It is a. Great scene and that that scene where. He says, you know where. His kind of surrogate daughter up until that point, asks him, you know, what does it cost everything. Yeah, it is. It is a terrifying explanation of what the character is. So yeah, we want to go a little bit into that. The the Reddit post. Yeah. There&rsquo;s a couple of really interesting examples it gives.
Speaker
Hmm.
Craig
But let&rsquo;s first set the scene and have a look at maybe. I don&rsquo;t. Lure of the dark side. Evil characters we root for techniques for creating empathy. Techniques for creating empathy. I think that&rsquo;s the the the one we&rsquo;re looking at here. So jumping into this is the film courage clip techniques for creating empathy for your villainous character. OK. OK, here we go.
Speaker 8
What is the definition of an antihero? An anti hero is someone who becomes evil for sympathetic reasons. This is why we like him. This is Michael Corleone in the Godfather. This is Harvey Dent in in in Dark Knight. We have to have sympathetic reasons to like an antihero.
Speaker 4
There&rsquo;s a whole bunch of techniques and you can see what they. Do.
Craig
Alright, so sympathetic reasons to like a. Antihero. So some of the clips. I came across this one is from the new. UM, invincible. Cartoon series superhero series and then the last season in the last few episodes, they bring this new character. In called conquest. And conquest is this super powerful villain character. It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s, you know, we&rsquo;re talking about kind of evil Superman level and there&rsquo;s this fantastic monologue that Conquest gives, which is similar to this question of at the moment where a character is pure evil, he&rsquo;s demonstrated various evil acts. Of killing innocent people in very gory grizzly way. Is this villain? Who, up until this point with this monologue that we&rsquo;re about to hear, seems to just be pure evil? But then he delivers this monologue, which changes our view of them somewhat, right? Maybe a little more empathy towards that character. So as we heard in that clip, we sometimes want. To create that. Empathy. So let&rsquo;s listen to this one minute clip of Conquests&rsquo;s best monologue from the Invincible anime series. This is season 3.
Speaker 1
I am so lonely. All the other philtre minds are scared of me. No one talks to me. No one wants to be my friend. They think I am unstable. They send me from planet to planet, committing atrocities in their name. And as I get better at it. They fear me more and more. I am a victim of my own success conquest. I don&rsquo;t even get a real name. Only on purpose. I am capable of so much more, and no one sees it. Some days I feel so alone. I could cry, but I don&rsquo;t. I never do, because what would be the point?
Speaker 8
I&rsquo;m going.
Craig
To so that&rsquo;s. Dramatic scene of conquest, delivering this really unexpected monologue about his loneliness. He&rsquo;s so lonely. No one likes me. I have no friends, right? Everyone hates me so much that they&rsquo;ve given me the name conquest. Which is just a purpose. Right. And it&rsquo;s such a dramatic scene. The It&rsquo;s interesting reading the. The quotes some of the the comments underneath it, talking about how dramatic that scene is, if we jump back to the film writing guide just to see how that empathetic moment can work.
Speaker 4
To know what the techniques are. For me, it&rsquo;s like there&rsquo;s three, three things that you do that I that you do is is make us make us feel sorry for that character. So there&rsquo;s little moments where you can you can create a moment in the story where a character is unjustly abused or unjustly mistreated or insulted. Or. Betrayed or neglected. And so it it could be any character. And if that moment is there, you&rsquo;re gonna feel sorry for that character at that moment. Takes an instant. So that&rsquo;s one. If you show that they&rsquo;re like us, if you show their humanity, for example, you show that they care about something other than themselves. That&rsquo;s another technique.
Craig
So I felt. That that&rsquo;s kind of the technique there. They&rsquo;re not. They kind of like conquest. This, this viltrumite alien. Kind of villain character. He&rsquo;s like a he&rsquo;s he feels lonely. Right. He doesn&rsquo;t have any friends, like he&rsquo;s writing a diary entry. The a diary. I feel so lonely today. I have no friends anyway. It&rsquo;s just really, profoundly banal, everyday depressing existential model.
Speaker 10
Ohh my God.
Speaker 4
So there&rsquo;s a moment in the movie A Leon the professional, which is about a a, a hit man, right? And it opens with him doing a hit and he kills people you don&rsquo;t know if he&rsquo;s good or bad, but he goes home and he takes care of a plant. Right. And that right away, you say, oh, well, he cares about the plant, so he&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s OK. The other part is admiration. So this is like any. Any kind of you know, if you&rsquo;re dating somebody or you&rsquo;re trying to find somebody who was a good match for you, there&rsquo;s that list of list of things that you like in a person that&rsquo;s admirable trait. So somebody was funny. Who&rsquo;s responsible, who&rsquo;s courageous. That&rsquo;s a whole list of things you can add to a character to make us say, oh, well, you know, I admire this. Usually they&rsquo;re like, the best at what they do. They like the best. You know the best ad executive or the best agent or the best cop, or. The best driver? They&rsquo;re courageous. There&rsquo;s a whole bunch of them. I have hope. The list. The list is all in.
Craig
So there&rsquo;s three characteristics there. One of the ones that was mentioned in the Reddit list of Moments in where a villainous character delivers a monologue which makes you see them a bit differently, is the scene from the matrix with Agent Smith, right? So this is the scene where. Morpheus has been captured. Agent Smith has been interrogating him. And then in this. Moment he takes off his earpiece so he&rsquo;s no longer connected to the other kind of androids. And delivers this manogue monologue about his.
Taylor
Feelings manogue. Is that what a man?
Craig
Man alot. Gives. Well, here&rsquo;s what a manity gives. So let&rsquo;s. The.
Speaker 5
Going to be honest. With you. I. Hate this place? This. Zoo. Prison. This reality, whatever you want to call it, I can&rsquo;t stand it any longer. It&rsquo;s the smell. If there are such things. I feel saturated by it. They can taste your stink. You&rsquo;re time I do. I fear that I have somehow been infected by it. It&rsquo;s propulsive, isn&rsquo;t it? I must get out of here. I must get free. And in this mind is the key my key.
Speaker 1
I was happy.
Craig
Such a such an interesting scene there that then again, that. Idea of humanising the villain.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
Up until this point, we&rsquo;ve seen him as a kind of robot, kind of mechanical, villainous character, and then this, I must get free. I hate it here. I hate the smell. Very relatable.
Taylor
Mr. Anderson. Do you know who my favourite anti villain is? Yes, I don&rsquo;t. Have a guess.
Craig
Well, some of the the I guess some of the classic anti villains, you got dirty Harry.
Taylor
No. It&rsquo;ll be 1 you don&rsquo;t expect.
Craig
Maybe the first act of Star Wars where it&rsquo;s handsome.
Taylor
Because because they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re not an anti villain. Sorry, anti hero.
Craig
Anti hero. Yeah anti villain would be. I hear it. Yeah. You, you, you finally got around to watching the Godfather.
Taylor
No, no, no. Corleone. It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s an anti hero who is the main character.
Craig
Right, Harry Potter.
Taylor
Michael Douglas in falling down.
Craig
OK. Yeah. OK. Yeah, that&rsquo;s a yeah. So falling down, there&rsquo;s a note is the story of a kind of salary man in America. He loses his job, but then so embarrassed. Yeah. So embarrassed about the loss of his job that he can&rsquo;t tell his wife. And he&rsquo;s still going.
Taylor
Guys on the ranch.
Craig
I mean. You know, dressing up in his suit as if he still got his job and then he has one. Of these. Worst days possible.
Taylor
Yeah, he gets stuck in traffic.
Craig
Right and. It gets stuck in traffic, it gets bad service at a fast food restaurants, gets accosted by some some thugs, and he he just he just flips out and and does this weird wishful. So he&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s kind of villainous in terms of, you know, his. He he can&rsquo;t face up to the truth. He. He&rsquo;s lying. He then does extreme overreactions. Yeah, in these moments, but kind of like, you know, human overreactions, but ones which know, like, he gets a gun at some point, and he&rsquo;s shooting people. He gets a baseball bat at some point, and he&rsquo;s finally.
Taylor
Yeah.
Speaker 5
Yeah.
Craig
Bashing people, you know, it&rsquo;s just it&rsquo;s just disproportionate. Yeah. And also a sense of entitlement that that really these are not big problems. Yeah, that he&rsquo;s facing. But he&rsquo;s blowing them up. Yeah, it&rsquo;s a great role. What? What? Was it about that? You, you. You.
Taylor
Enjoyed. Ohh. It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s really like the movie and I&rsquo;d I&rsquo;d like that disproportionate response to it. And I was so sad when he got shot to death at the end. But.
Craig
Look, it is cause look tip. I mean, you could do a different version of. That movie where? He is redeemed right where it is that kind.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
Of which which? Is why I think the movie is so good that they don&rsquo;t concede that trope of, you know, because basically. You know, it&rsquo;s that kind of, you know what we&rsquo;re seeing today with Trump saying that, you know, Oh my God, the worst person. And the people in the world are these oppressed, alleged, you know, white genocide sufferers in South South Africa, right. It&rsquo;s this kind of, you know, the idea that that a, an identity which has been considered. The the patriarchal privileged norm white male in particular is somehow struggling and so not living a life. Which is meant to be the same, similar in falling down. It takes that hypocrisy or that sense of lack of of any sense of a realistic base of what real suffering might look like. Yeah. Yeah. No, that&rsquo;s. Yeah, that&rsquo;s a great choice. It&rsquo;s an underprivileged. Watched movie. I feel it is.
Taylor
Yes.
Craig
All right. So let&rsquo;s jump in. Where are we? What&rsquo;s the time? 2 minutes left. Alright. So we&rsquo;ll hear a little bit more about the guide. To writing evil characters.
Speaker 4
Book there&rsquo;s all these lists of things you can do, but if you do these three things, and so when I show clips of the of the moment you meet the character and it&rsquo;s usually like a 3 minute scene. You can see all these things being applied in like 3 minutes. There&rsquo;s like, you know, the the opening of WALL-E after he&rsquo;s done with the garbage and he comes to his to his little house. It&rsquo;s a 3 minute scene and it&rsquo;s about 20 of these techniques done. This is how you connect with that character in one scene emotionally. Also show a clip of a of A of an ad, a commercial. It&rsquo;s a one minute. Thing about a lamb.
Craig
So the next one I mean, is this really interesting scene from well, in a way. Yeah. Some people in the chat mentioned this scene in Star Wars as being one which which. Agendas. Humanising of the of the character.
Speaker 7
So you have accepted the truth.
Speaker 4
I&rsquo;ve accepted the truth.
Speaker 11
That you will, once Anakin Skywalker my father.
Speaker 7
That name no longer has any meaning for me.
Speaker 4
It is the name of your true self. You&rsquo;ve only.
Speaker 1
Forgotten? No, there is good.
Speaker 5
The Emperor hasn&rsquo;t driven it from you.
Speaker 9
For me to come.
Speaker 7
Hobby one, once thought as you do.
Speaker 5
I&rsquo;m sorry, Eric. For all.
Speaker 7
Of it, you don&rsquo;t know the power of the dark side. I must obey. I must.
Speaker 5
I will not turn.
Speaker
And you&rsquo;ll be forced.
Speaker 7
To kill if that is with destiny.
Speaker 8
You can&rsquo;t do this.
Speaker 11
I feel the conflict within you. Let go of. Your hate.
Speaker 7
We lose too late.
Speaker 1
My father is truly.
Craig
Different. Alright, so that&rsquo;s the same return of the Jedi defender Luke Skywalker. And again, those moments where Darkseid is delivering those lanes of, you know you don&rsquo;t know the power of the dark side. Not in terms of where you should join me in the dark side, but a true sense of the oppressiveness of that ideology is is under. And that final scene, you know. It&rsquo;s too late for me, son. Is quite alright. Well that. Last clip one, I think that you&rsquo;ll be. Able to respond. To sure. Again, here we have a classic scene. I want to tell you.
Taylor
Voldemort.
Craig
It&rsquo;s not that. One, it&rsquo;s the it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s Gollum. It&rsquo;s something I know you&rsquo;ve got a background in. It&rsquo;s a scene where one of the big villains in this series is delivering a kind of justification for their actions.
Taylor
Let&rsquo;s call.
Craig
Them right and. It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s not necessarily humanising or admiring them, but it is providing us with an insight into, OK, well, they&rsquo;re not just.
Taylor
MHM.
Craig
Doing villainy because yeah, they want to. It&rsquo;s for some other reason.
Speaker 10
Now future errors will be eradicated, defeats will become victories. You will have changed the future of the.
Craig
Universe. So of course this is Doctor Who facing off against. Ross. Yeah, in the classic Tom Baker series. So this is this great kind of face off between the two characters. I&rsquo;m just waiting until it gets to the scene that I want to.
Speaker 6
It&rsquo;s not the machines, it&rsquo;s the.
Craig
Unpack.
Taylor
This is genesis.
Craig
Of the dogs genesis. That&rsquo;s right. Yeah. Genesis Daleks consider one of probably the best episodes in Doctor Who&rsquo;s history. So there&rsquo;s a bit of intellectual sparring between what these Daleks represents.
Speaker 10
With the darlings of the supreme rulers of the universe there. You will have peace. Wars will end. They are the power, not of evil. But of God.
Speaker 6
Davros. If you had created a virus in your laboratory, something contagious and infectious that killed on contact a virus that would destroy all other forms of life. Would you allow its?
Speaker 10
Use. It is an interesting conjecture, only living thing.
Speaker 6
Would you do?
Speaker 4
It.
Speaker 10
The microscopic Organism.
Speaker 9
Reigning supreme.
Speaker 10
Fascinating idea.
Speaker 6
But would you do it?
Speaker 10
Yes.
Speaker 1
Yes.
Speaker 10
To hold in my hand a capsule that contained such power. To know that life and death on such a scale was my choice. To know that the tiny pressure on my son enough to break the glass would end. Everything.
Speaker 1
Yeah.
Speaker 10
I would do it.
Speaker 11
That power would sit me up above the gods and through the darlings. I shall have that power.
Craig
Well, great scene, great scenes. So again, you know, in terms of Dan Ross&rsquo;s villainy, you know, the Doctor asks that question. Of. You know Dave Ross, if in one of your experiments you created the virus accidentally that you discovered that virus could kill every living being, you know, would you decide to destroy that virus or not? And I guess it&rsquo;s a test there of because what&rsquo;s happening in this episode is the doctor is struggling with this. Decision of does he kill the Daleks or not? Like he said, the genesis of the Daleks highly suggest is is the inception point at which the Ducks begin. Doctor is afforded this opportunity to.
Taylor
Yes.
Craig
Wipe him out. To eradicate them at the moment of their. And so this question is kind of testing, is Davros really a bad game, right? Is there any remaining empathy or sense of, you know, if Davros answered, for instance, Gee, you know, yeah. Obviously, if I found that I&rsquo;d accidentally made this virus that kills everyone. Yeah, that&rsquo;s pretty horrible. I don&rsquo;t want to kill everyone. I just want to.
Taylor
I think that&rsquo;s also a turning point of where the Doctor realises that Davros would destroy if he could. And so therefore the right thing to do would be to not.
Craig
Destroy that, Davros ultimately is irredeemable in terms of even a hypothetical question. That&rsquo;s not about creating a master race. Garlic species that are going to bring peace to the world, right? So again, that was just before then, but, you know. Actually, the dogs aren&rsquo;t an instrument for evil. They like Thanos going to bring a sense of of balance and peace around us. We&rsquo;re going to wipe out every other, you know, kind of aggressive species.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
And be left with peace. And yes, the dialects will just happen to be at the top of that space, so again he shifts it by saying OK, we&rsquo;re not talking about dialects anymore, we&rsquo;re talking about a virus, a virus that would even kill every other person here. And even with that, we were revealed the idea that DeVos is wants power. He wants at least to be recognised. Eyes. Like a God at being able to decide who lives and dies. So a very Thanos type God complex in terms of you know that it it&rsquo;s nevertheless an attempt by the script writers to humanise that villain action. Right. Yeah. Why? Would someone want to do this? Why would someone want to create super soldiers?
Taylor
Daleks slash Nazis, which is what it was based on, yeah.
Craig
Yeah, yeah, yeah. And it&rsquo;s such a fantastic unpacking of that, that, that idea. And I guess, yeah. So Davos doesn&rsquo;t shift into being an anti villain. And to hear. The same thing. Anti hero? Yeah, because it&rsquo;s potentially a lot a a kind of sequence of thoughts that could change the character. Yeah, right. Where he goes. Yes, I see now, doctor, the error of my ways right. Clearly there should be cheques and balances. I don&rsquo;t just want to kill everyone, but there&rsquo;s like.
Taylor
No, no. Why yes, now I would use that power.
Craig
One few to decide who lives and dies to be a God. Yeah. So it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s. It&rsquo;s a nice scene. And again the the the rising of the voice. And of course, yeah. Then the doctor decides. You know, he&rsquo;s got to get Davros to kill the Daleks, right? You know, to wipe out Davros and the Daleks. Yeah. Think about that in terms of, if you&rsquo;re finding yourself facing off against a villain, yeah, you know, raising a villain. Is there a moment to humanise them, and does that? Help create a more engaging story if you haven&rsquo;t seen it, do watch falling down. Yeah worth watching and and yeah, that&rsquo;s me meeting mothership for another week. We&rsquo;ll dive into some more unpacking of media around us next week and. Before we sign off, any promotions for the new show, you&rsquo;re setting up Taylor, no?
Taylor
Not yet.
Craig
They&rsquo;re still Facebook, though. DM for Epley.
Taylor
There&rsquo;s still a Facebook at DM for Airplay, but it&rsquo;s not going to be for the next two weeks because I have exams next.
Craig
Week so. Ohh yeah. Wow. We, we you could do an exam themed music show. What music to listen to for exams?
Taylor
Songs to scratch out your eyes too.
Craig
Yeah, alright. Well, that&rsquo;s the media mothership for another week. Keep listening now to some really cool tunes on Edge radio. If you want to find out more about the email, so feel free to jump on the Facebook page for us or the Instagram page. Back episodes are also on YouTube.
Taylor
And you can buy cracker coffee.
Craig
If you want coffee, it&rsquo;s not a not a cheap option these days, or you can go podcast you can you can search for us on on the podcast provider or.
