Speaker 1
There is nothing wrong with your radio.
Speaker
Do not attempt to adjust the volume. We are controlling. For the next hour, we will control all that you hear.
Speaker 1
You are about to experience the knowledge and insights of the media mothership.
Craig
Alright, welcome here to Edge Radio 99.3 FM and this is media mothership. I&rsquo;m your host. Doctor Craig. Oh, we&rsquo;ve got the doctor back. I&rsquo;m feeling pretty confident about winning it. Let&rsquo;s try and pull out any qualifications I have joined by. Do you want to plan any of your qualifications? Magister. Yeah, magister. And that&rsquo;s based on.
Taylor
That&rsquo;s based on the old it. It means master, and so therefore a masters is a magister and you know doctor is a doctor.
Speaker
Ohh.
Craig
Right. And you&rsquo;ve of course you you did a A. Job with. I can remember your honours.
Taylor
Yeah, yeah. And then did a master teaching.
Craig
Master. Yes. Yeah, I&rsquo;m trying to. Remember and I sleep 3. You were masters or something, right? Supervise that all.
Taylor
Right. But actually in in Norway, I think I think it&rsquo;s Norway, they still call a a Manchester, you become a Manchester.
Craig
Sounds like a judge.
Taylor
Yeah, it does. Yeah, magistrate.
Craig
Yeah, alright, well. On today&rsquo;s show, we&rsquo;re going to talk about video games. In popular culture? Yeah. And it&rsquo;s mainly triggered by this little Grand Theft Auto. Hmm. Hamlet trailer. So we&rsquo;ll listen to this to to put us in the mood.
Speaker 4
Go, go, go, go now. OK, OK. We are putting on a production of Hamlet in GTA Online for the first time ever. We are looking for actors. So come and audition, please. Trying to stop us. Can&rsquo;t stop our mother.
Speaker
Yes.
Speaker 4
Ohh they got me.
Speaker
Ohh, my God, they&rsquo;re really coming down now look. To.
Speaker 1
Be or not to be. That is the question.
Speaker 4
You&rsquo;re welcome to audition if you want. You&rsquo;ll put, don&rsquo;t.
Speaker
You crazy? No. OK. Shoot us please.
Speaker 4
But it is nobler in the mind to suffer.
Speaker
Ohh.
Speaker 5
My God.
Speaker 4
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, or to take arms to get to sea of travel.
Speaker
No one&rsquo;s going to come. No one cares.
Speaker 4
It&rsquo;s not a real thing.
Speaker 1
It&rsquo;s real to me.
Speaker
Ohh, hang on. Someone&rsquo;s here. Hello.
Speaker 5
All right, you can call me Shawn. I&rsquo;m Jen. I&rsquo;m Kelly.
Speaker 4
That&rsquo;s quite an entrance.
Speaker
My name is Gareth.
Speaker 4
While you&rsquo;re doing your dance, we try saying to be or not to be. That is the question.
Speaker 5
Look, my Lord, it comes she&rsquo;s like chick.
Speaker 4
Bear on our billion dollar budget.
Speaker
Cops are here.
Craig
Maybe he&rsquo;s a purist.
Speaker
We just keep coming across these people. We wanna help us.
Speaker 4
That gives me hope that what we&rsquo;re trying to do is possible. Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to Grand Theft Hamlet.
Speaker
Yes.
Craig
OK. Hey, so that&rsquo;s was the synopsis from. Grand Theft. Dang it.
Speaker 6
Although I&rsquo;m not sure if you.
Craig
Heard the Grand Theft Auto. Let me just put. That volume down. Grand Theft Hamlet trailer #1 which details the. In the midst of COVID-19 pandemic, 2 out of work actors Sam and Mark, piece of bleak future. Desperate for purpose, they stumble upon an idea stage Shakespeare&rsquo;s hamlet with the ultraviolet within the ultraviolet world of Grand Theft Auto. Online shot. Entirely in game Grand Theft, Hamlet explores their attempt to merge classical theatre with a chaotic digital landscape. With stunning visuals and unexpected moments of reflection, this engaging documentary examines how ancient cultural narratives. Can still resonate in new virtual spaces, raising questions about art, isolation and the digital world&rsquo;s potential for storytelling.
Taylor
You know, the strange thing about that is how they said like because of COVID-19. That was an out of work actors. Yes, as an actor myself, you&rsquo;re always out of work until some ridiculous director decides to actually put you into a. Production it&rsquo;s pretty.
Craig
Status quo environment to be in, isn&rsquo;t it?
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
Anyway, and this this Harkins back way back, ohh maybe 10-15 years ago I had to teach a class at university on video games, virtual worlds and video games.
Taylor
Yeah, I remember it.
Speaker
And.
Craig
Wasn&rsquo;t. Yeah, you were in it. And I was pitching these ideas around how to take video games and put it into the real world. So to help us on this journey today, we&rsquo;ve brought along our special guest, Leo. Hey, Leo. You do your own show here on Edge every Tuesday.
Leo
Hi. 11 yeah, 11, it&rsquo;s hyperfixation sensation. Yeah, basically spring and running people such as you, Craig.
Craig
That&rsquo;s right. I was on. It&rsquo;s.
Leo
Yeah. So yeah, this Tuesday. So yeah, that&rsquo;s basically Marshall, I guess so.
Speaker 6
Tuesday.
Craig
Yeah. And I we talked about board.
Leo
Games. Oh yeah, we did. Yeah, I found that. It was quite a good show. We got track a couple of times, but.
Craig
It just always happens. So hyper fixation sensation and in many ways media mothership really does take that as its motorsport.
Leo
It&rsquo;s. Fun. Yeah.
Craig
One day it&rsquo;s our whole purpose. We dive deeply into whatever fascination I&rsquo;ve stumbled across that way. Often it&rsquo;s old, the oldie radio from the 1930s, but today we&rsquo;re going high tech modern and we&rsquo;ve got big boy needy already on the chat. Thanks, big boy. Needy. You can of course watch us on.
Taylor
Yeah, exactly. OK.
Craig
YouTube Stream, Twitch Stream, digital broadcast DAB, the FM system on analogue 99.3 FM or just head over to edgeradio.org Dot AU.
Taylor
And send us a message at 488811707.
Craig
Yeah. Which Big Boy Navy has done. Hey, big bosses. Sorry, I&rsquo;m 3 minutes late. I keep forgetting it&rsquo;s Thursday listening whilst I play flight SIM and eat my Dino nuggies. Great because I I know Leah. You&rsquo;re a huge fan.
Leo
Ohh yeah. Yeah, I personally love playing. I used to have yeah explain.
Craig
X plane. Yep. So that&rsquo;s like Microsoft Flight Simulator. It&rsquo;s one of those ones where you can fly from a real world airport. What&rsquo;s some of your flying experiences in X plane?
Leo
So.
Craig
Have you flown from Hobart Airport?
Leo
Yeah, I have so.
Craig
What&rsquo;s it like? Did you crash?
Leo
No. Well, I have crashed before.
Craig
But not in Hobart. Great. What was your biggest crash?
Leo
Well. Probably probably the time when I was messing around with my throttle and I didn&rsquo;t know what the red lever was. Wow.
Craig
Yeah, always do the red lever.
Speaker
If there&rsquo;s a red.
Craig
Yeah.
Leo
Commit. Turns out it was a mixture and I pulled it and my engine stopped.
Craig
Wow. And how did you you didn&rsquo;t recover? What happens just plummeted.
Leo
Well, I tried pushing it. I tried to push it back in, but by that point, now I know later the engine and spool down so I couldn&rsquo;t push it back into favourite.
Craig
Right.
Leo
So what I would have had to have done is restarted my yeah. And I was like 9.
Craig
Was it a propeller plane or a jet?
Leo
Yeah, it was. It was like session 172.
Craig
Plane repellent, rights of fear. Was this over Paris or somewhere exciting?
Leo
Well, it was over. I think it was near the I think I landed on the highway here like on Hwy. Yeah. But in doing so, I smashed into a SUV. Yeah, yeah.
Craig
There&rsquo;s damn SUV&rsquo;s. They should get out of the way of the planes. I mean, Harrison Ford landed on the golf course a few years ago in his, I think as a World War 2 type aeroplane. My favourite bit of video game journalism with flight simulators was this guy. And it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s one of these early new games journalism pieces which tries to do a very immersive non, you know, point scoring approach to video game reviewing. And they did it on one of the early Microsoft Flight Sims and their their their whole review was written about their attempt. To do the like the Lindenberg crossing right. So from New York to London, I think then crossing was. In the same aeroplane, right? So in the flight SIM you can get that same spirit of Saint Louis, whatever it is, aeroplane, but he.
Leo
Isn&rsquo;t that isn&rsquo;t that playing like really hard to?
Craig
See out of it is. Yeah. It&rsquo;s very obscured kind of vision, but what he did was he did it in real time. So it took 12 hours or something and he sat there and he what he did, he said beforehand he wanted to immerse himself, cause it&rsquo;s a simulator, right? It&rsquo;s not a video game. You simulate reality. So what he did is he packed his lunches. He said OK, I&rsquo;ll need. I&rsquo;ll need breakfast and lunches. So sandwiches and so forth probably. Have and I&rsquo;ll. I&rsquo;ll be in this seat, he. Did I think? He allowed himself toilet breaks. Yeah, I hope he did. I don&rsquo;t remember the toilet discussion.
Taylor
And he took altitude medication and those squishy socks. Yeah.
Craig
That&rsquo;s right, anti nausea. And he said it was, you know, the first part of the game was kind of exciting, but then it&rsquo;s just really boring you just some. And I know people have done that with Euro Truck Simulator where they&rsquo;ll do a fundraiser where it&rsquo;ll just be because it&rsquo;s one again one of these.
Leo
Yeah.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
Leaders where it&rsquo;s just they&rsquo;ll take the. Just you know US truck journey and they&rsquo;ll say I&rsquo;m live streaming it for the next 8 hours, which is the real time it would take to go from, I don&rsquo;t know, New York to California and that&rsquo;s it. That&rsquo;s the stream and they&rsquo;ll be raising money and and all this is kind of like ultimately what I want to arrive at. By the end of today&rsquo;s episode, so in the next 40 minutes, is is how we can put media mothership in some form of video game, right? Like to do a video game and media mothership at the same time, like Hamlet in GTA. You know, we brainstorm, like, have you played?
Leo
Roblox you have.
Craig
Because I reckon. That the even the equipment here could play Roblox. On.
Speaker
OK.
Craig
Could we do a? Media Mothership episode live in a Roblox space.
Leo
Yeah, I actually could.
Craig
Is there a? Is there a? Is there a radio studio in Roblox? Is there a radio studio game?
Leo
Uh. Make one.
Craig
There we go. So join us on our Kickstarter. We just need to do a hire a video game.
Leo
If there&rsquo;s any Roblox developers message in on 0488811707 or you can find our number on the top left of our website at radio.org dot AU. It should be. On the little.
Craig
Banner thing? That&rsquo;s right. The little banner thing. Alright and you&rsquo;re joining media. The ship here. On.
Taylor
It&rsquo;s ready.
Craig
3899.3 I want to get my kalimba. Can you finish the rest of the?
Taylor
OK. Yeah. No, no, I actually don&rsquo;t have anything to say. Craig is going and getting his kalimba out of his bag. He&rsquo;s wearing a blue cap today and red shirt red. Sort of. Yeah. Jumper thing and.
Leo
Red shirt. Black losses.
Craig
All right, welcome. Back that was worth it. It breaks the. Me. Audio space people wake. Up they might be falling asleep. We&rsquo;re talking about video games with our special guest Leo and our co-host Magister Taylor and Doctor Craig. Actually, we need to find the title for you by the end of the show, so we&rsquo;ll brainstorm a bit of news and video games. I did do a survey of current video game news. Let&rsquo;s play.
Leo
Yeah, probably.
Craig
A sample of this. It&rsquo;s from the latest Chinese video game.
Taylor
Turn the volume up.
Craig
That&rsquo;s not the name. Ohh on this? Yeah.
Taylor
But no on that. Ohh yet.
Craig
Video. Games called Wu Chang full and feathers.
Taylor
Wu.
Craig
Chang Wu Chang and here&rsquo;s here&rsquo;s the title. Woo Chang got hit by the censorship hammer here. We.
Taylor
OK.
Craig
Go.
Speaker 6
Well, I&rsquo;m not sure if you heard it. This game got censored by. By their own developers, essentially like changing the entire game. The changing all of the storyline, everything. No, no, the censorship is not because of fanservice. It&rsquo;s because during the entire game. The changing all of the storyline, everything. No, no, the censorship is not because of fanservice. It&rsquo;s because in this game. Our protagonist essentially is killing the Ming dynasty, the remnants of the Ming dynasty. Who are? People of Han like. Descendants of Han the Han people. That&rsquo;s why Chinese Chinese fans were mad about this. This is essentially talking about the Manchurian like. Oh, the manchurians overtaking the Ming dynasty. That&rsquo;s why people are kind of mad about this. Not because of like the fan service, mainly because of historical stuff.
Craig
All right. So that was a starry in TV and his take on the censorship hammer in Wu Chang, full and feathers. So if you didn&rsquo;t catch what he was saying, what&rsquo;s happened is that there was a patch recently done, which meant that it it basically transformed entirely. The type of challenges you face in this game. It&rsquo;s a souls like game, right? So you know it&rsquo;s you got Insta death and it&rsquo;s quite challenging and you know quite photorealistic it&rsquo;s set in this kind of ancient Chinese period where you can challenge various big bosses, but it transform those challenges so that you can no longer.
Speaker
MHM.
Craig
Kill those classic Ming dynasty mythical boss figures. You can only exhaust them, and that was because there was a right wing conservative national. Backlash against this game, saying hey, you can&rsquo;t kill our national figures in this game, right? These these mythological symbols of China.
Taylor
Yeah. Going against again against the hand people, which consists which make up like 85% of the entire population of China. So it&rsquo;s a, it&rsquo;s a big number.
Craig
Deserve more respect. Right, that&rsquo;s. So it meant that the the the games own developers went back into it, modified that. Many people have saying that has resulted in. In breaking the game, because you can know, you can now no longer, you know, finish certain parts of it. You can&rsquo;t get these award. You can&rsquo;t, so it kind of contradicts the whole stakes that the games built up around. So there&rsquo;s an article in rock, Paper, Shotgun, PC gaming since 1873. 1873 piece of gaming. So it&rsquo;s.
Taylor
Close to when you were born, right?
Craig
I&rsquo;m nearly 200.
Taylor
Ohh no, I was 19, not 18.
Craig
After which young, full and fair, there&rsquo;s controversial Patch 1.5 made key bosses immortal. Here&rsquo;s the obligatory rollback. Mod So Video Gamer has modded it to reintroduce the deaths of those characters in a mod. So so yeah, go for it, mods. Well, it&rsquo;s always a happy kind of, you know, some of these models do all the heavy lifting for fixing, you know, when when the.
Speaker
Brilliant.
Craig
Updates break the.
Leo
Game a lot of games I&rsquo;ve played, they&rsquo;ve had a lot of problems with updates breaking games. Such as running on art, which is? Well, I believe we&rsquo;re gonna be talking about.
Craig
Later. Is that correct? Yeah. Well, let&rsquo;s go into that now. So ready. Or not was the. It&rsquo;s like a a game video game.
Leo
First person, first person shooter. Basically, you&rsquo;re a tactical SWAT officer and you run a team of five people, including yourself, so it can be AI. It can be real people, so you know, with real people you can have as many people as you like under 5 people. But there are some odds. That allow you to. Have more. Basically, my microphone is a little bit muscle because it keeps on sinking and I lift it up. So basically you are a spot officer and you try to disable any kind of any kind of threats and you try to preserve life.
Craig
It does.
Leo
Like most other tactical shooters where you&rsquo;re trying to actively, you know, shoot people and kill them. In ready or not, one really cool thing that I like about it is you&rsquo;re actually almost like a real spot officer where you&rsquo;re trying to actually stop people from dying by using less lethal munitions and stuff like that. And the only way to be able to get the S rank, which is the highest rank inside of each server, is by not having. Anyone die? Wow. Whatsoever. So it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a lot more of a different type of type of tactical shooter than most other tactical shooters out there, such as Fortnite, or that&rsquo;s not exactly tactical, but like.
Craig
Well, this team. Work sometimes.
Leo
But yeah, it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a lot. It&rsquo;s a lot different to a lot of other shooters out there, you know, so.
Craig
Yeah. Well, actually dovetails into what, big boy? Needy. Thanks again for messaging in Big Boy. Needy has messaging just there saying there are GTA modded servers, they do like role play servers. The client is called 5 M so you could look them up. So that&rsquo;s so that we could. Think about if we get a computer that can play GTA, but that sounds very role play based, right? Ready or not. Well, let&rsquo;s listen to the trailer. I&rsquo;ve I&rsquo;ve pulled up the trailer here for radio or not. Are you ready? Official 1.0 launch from last year.
Leo
Not exactly role play. No, exactly.
Speaker 5
911 this call is being recorded. What is your emergency? I I need the police to you need to send the police. Right away. Come help me. Sorry, I&rsquo;m sorry.
Speaker

Speaker 5
Her go. I&rsquo;m not going.
Speaker 1
So Are you ready?
Craig
Alright, so that was ready or not. Are you ready? Official 1.0 launch trailer we had talking about video games, immersive video games, and I&rsquo;m doctor Craig, joined by Multicolor Taylor.
Taylor
3.
Craig
It&rsquo;s magic, Magister Taylor and DJ Leo. At this point, DJ Leo, we&rsquo;ll go with DJ Leo.
Taylor
Registered.
Leo
Personally.
Craig
We&rsquo;ll keep workshopping that. And so why do you need to be ready to play this game if you&rsquo;re not ready, do you lose? Game.
Leo
So there is a certain mode where if you aren&rsquo;t ready, then you lose. It&rsquo;s called Ironman mode. So basically you need to run in and it&rsquo;s very similar to real life where if you die you lose your entire save file. You ohh nice. Yeah, I love that man, yeah.
Craig
All right. Instant permadeath. But you don&rsquo;t die in real life. Till that&rsquo;s clear, it&rsquo;s not the matrix.
Leo
Unless you use the VR mode where where you can, you know that you know, you know that you know that the headset that can kill you if you lose inside of.
Craig
It&rsquo;s like the matrix. Ohh wow is that the one?
Leo
A game. Yeah, yeah.
Craig
That I use and you make.
Leo
That&rsquo;s a that&rsquo;s also the arm on. So if you use those two combined, then you know.
Craig
Sounds like the saw movie or something, yeah?
Taylor
Kinda.
Craig
I I reckon we could do photojournalism in that game, right? We&rsquo;ll be interviewing the other people that play the game while we&rsquo;re playing it. Is it a multiplayer game? Yes. Yeah. Yeah. So I&rsquo;d. Say you know I&rsquo;m an in bed from. The Murdoch newspaper and I&rsquo;m here to to to create a news story and and we&rsquo;ll do it live radio.
Taylor
You&rsquo;re a. You&rsquo;re a. You&rsquo;re a what?
Craig
In bed. In bed, in bed in bed. Ohh. You&rsquo;re listening to me? Your mothership here on Edge Radio 99.3 film. And yeah, yeah, cause Time magazine actually did this where they sent one of their news photo journalists into who, who, who covered numerous war zones, and they gave him his his assignment for one of the time magazines was go into the video game. Last of Us and create a photojournalism report on it as if you&rsquo;re a photojournalist in an actual world setting and he said he found it actually really difficult to not create basically advertising for the video game because it looks so. Good. And you can craft video games. So what? So you can there are some video games where you can get like a photo mode or you can create like a screenshot from it. And they&rsquo;re designed for creating really engaging photos that you share. And he was saying he was able to create some. Some pieces which were gesturing quite classical, photojournalism, conflict, war zone pieces, but he was saying, yeah, actually by the end of it, he felt it was desensitising the video game experience left him quite worried about the the type of media effect with. Games. How have you found ready or not in terms of, you know, cause at one level there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s guns and violence, but then another level cause it&rsquo;s cop you&rsquo;re having to to do a lot of real World Team building, communicating some really important skills. How do you find the team building nature of radio or not? You multiplay on it. Or single play.
Leo
Yeah, I do play. I do multiplayer on it sometimes, but at the moment I&rsquo;m mostly single playing it, but with AI teammates. But something really cool I&rsquo;ve discovered when it comes to a single player is you actually have to deal with your teammates stress. So if your teammates become too stressed, they&rsquo;re like if they become anxious, they&rsquo;re their performance degrades. If they become stressed.
Craig
Yeah.
Leo
Even more degrades if they become a crisis like in crisis. Then they can either quit or they get intervention from the therapist.
Craig
In the game.
Leo
Yeah, in the.
Craig
Game really, really is there, like a stress metre or something like how does it? How does it detect your?
Leo
Stress levels, not your stress levels, your teammate stress levels.
Craig
I was really hoping you could weigh yourself up to it. I just blow it immediately.
Leo
So basically, the more people that die inside a mission, the higher the stresses. So if they see your teammate die or something like that, right?
Craig
Right. The game would say in a normal setting this character would be suffering this level of stress. I&rsquo;ve heard of a similar mechanic in the the thing. Game, where there&rsquo;s a paranoia which can tip you over the edge.
Leo
So basically, yeah, you can do multiple things to do to fix stress. Main thing is going to be sending them into a therapist, but that means that there&rsquo;s gonna be two missions where you don&rsquo;t have your specific officer cause.
Craig
They&rsquo;re, they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;ve, they&rsquo;ve gotten their car and gone. To a therapist? Yeah. To go have an appointment.
Leo
And then and the next thing that you can do is get S bags. I don&rsquo;t know what that stands for so.
Craig
Don&rsquo;t ask. See that would be. I mean we could do medium mother ship in there. I wonder how quickly we&rsquo;d be sent to see if. Therapist because of the content and be like you guys are not healthy. This is not a healthy discussion. I suggest therapy.
Leo
And then. It&rsquo;s also moral, moral, something. Basically they they heavily make suspects mental health. I mean, not suspects. Teammates. Mental health better by helping bring suspects out alive. So.
Craig
So you&rsquo;re actually incentivised.
Leo
Yeah. So there&rsquo;s many different things. Yeah, there&rsquo;s many things inside of the game which kind of encourages you to bring out your suspects alive.
Craig
Bring people out alive. Because normally you&rsquo;d see like a health media for a character, but there are these other metres or these other feedback you&rsquo;re getting on the screen, the HUD telling you of the the mental health state of the the character you&rsquo;re in.
Leo
That&rsquo;s not. That&rsquo;s not until you&rsquo;re at the end of the game, like at the.
Craig
Right. Which is so much like life. It&rsquo;s not until I finished the episode that I realised.
Leo
End of the mission.
Craig
How traumatic I am. Yeah. How much therapy I need?
Leo
So so for example, you know every single, every single step that you take inside of the game. Really matters, yes. So yeah, if you take one step to the right, there could be a suspect over there with 762AK47. And you can die and.
Craig
So the stakes are high. Yeah, right. And and as you&rsquo;re saying, if you&rsquo;re playing Imam, the that&rsquo;s it. The character points you&rsquo;ve accumulated, they&rsquo;re just gone.
Leo
And that&rsquo;s the other cool things about it is it&rsquo;s realistic. You don&rsquo;t exactly see any health bars or any. It&rsquo;s.
Craig
Literally right.
Leo
Like you, you can see a little body of yours in the bottom left, and then you can see you know what parts of your body are injured. So for example, if your right leg is injured and you try to kick down a door, it gets even more injured. And then once it becomes critical, your right leg, you&rsquo;re unable to kick down. Doors and the great thing here.
Craig
Is this is in a safe space? Right. You&rsquo;re not physically kicking down the door. Yourself. Yeah, which I think is a huge relief to most people. It&rsquo;s interesting was I had a student once in, in. That video game unit. Who did his project on? You know his dad and his elder brother were part of the military, and he wasn&rsquo;t part of the military, but he loved playing Call of Duty and other first person shooter games. So he did a project on, you know, does military service help you get better scores? In Call of Duty, right. So he said. Yeah, yeah. Can you shoot better? And he said, you know, he interviewed because his brother and his dad played Call of Duty, and they would have their own squad and all the people in the squad would be ex military or current military.
Taylor
Can you shoot better? That sort of thing?
Craig
And he said as he was watching them, like he went around to a friend&rsquo;s place and they were playing the game and or he&rsquo;s listening online is they were doing it, he said. One of the things that he found that was the biggest difference was the communication they. Were able to. Do that, he said that as opposed to when he plays with his mates, where if you give anyone feedback. They can act up and get really angry and say, well, buddy, I&rsquo;m not playing with you anymore. I&rsquo;m playing it to have fun. Stop telling me. What to do? Instead, these guys would actually take on any criticism that do a debrief and discuss, and they wouldn&rsquo;t take it personally, he said. That was the thing that was most surprised at the fact that. That it was that communication, that&rsquo;s what they said. They said that, you know, it&rsquo;s a huge difference between firing a real gun and the virtual gun. There&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s no correlation. Like it won&rsquo;t help you if you have good real gun skills like a soldier does to be good gun game guy in the game, it&rsquo;s completely different. Lot of mechanisms and kind of twitch and muscle. Sorry, but what we&rsquo;ll help. We&rsquo;ll help you, he said in his project. Was the fact that his brother and his dad were able to take on criticism and teamwork and Co-op much better than him and his mates who would always get angry. At each other. And be like wouldn&rsquo;t use their words to explain. The frustration in the game, so yeah, I do think a game like that could be really helpful in in building up discussion. So when you&rsquo;ve played it online. Is it with other people from Australia or?
Leo
Other countries, primarily Australia, just because of paying and you know Internet speeds and stuff like that. That&rsquo;s how it works for most online games. Yeah. So I actually made one friend off of it. Yeah, it was pretty fun. One thing I do have to say about the communication side of the game. When it comes to single play, again, you actually have really strong communication abilities. So basically if you medically you can select. Orders. So number one is moved to #2.
Craig
Right, giving instructions to your virtual.
Speaker
Is.
Leo
Squad. Yeah, #2. I believe it&rsquo;s fallen. And then we&rsquo;re full and you can pick between Wedge Diamond, single file and double file lines.
Craig
And that could really help going to Woolworths right when you&rsquo;re shopping with friends. And it&rsquo;s like falling single file line here please, because we&rsquo;re going into the the single extend it&rsquo;s difficult to tell people.
Leo
What to do? Move in, move in clear with flashback.
Craig
I&rsquo;d love that feature in the real world.
Leo
Clear the clear the measly I&rsquo;ll flashback.
Craig
We&rsquo;ve got a message from Big Boy Lady, my brother in law is in the army and when he wasn&rsquo;t in when he isn&rsquo;t working, he&rsquo;s playing Call of Duty. There&rsquo;s some concern that he&rsquo;s worried that he just wants to kill.
Speaker 4
Yes.
Craig
Yes, but there is a difference between the virtual world and the real world. Fortunately, button is sending a nice sum 🙂 to you.
Taylor
Mr Lidstone, what&rsquo;s that?
Craig
Button. Do you know a button? Button. Yes. Thank you anyway. Button for messaging.
Taylor
Well, how do you know this?
Craig
And it to me because it says I the the less than symbol three you. Mr listen. I think that&rsquo;s a.
Leo
Heart. Yeah, that&rsquo;s a heart.
Taylor
Oh dear.
Leo
So was it I heart, Mr Lidstone.
Taylor
Yes, yeah, yeah. Let&rsquo;s stop using. My last name, OK.
Craig
It&rsquo;s true, magistry. Patton, it&rsquo;s Jimmy in Green Nine. OK, there you go. It&rsquo;s all falling into place. So we&rsquo;re talking here on media mothership. On Edge Radio 99.3 FM you can play it tough. No, man. If you think you have better Columbo skills than the master DJ Craig, feel free to let us know in the chat. We&rsquo;ll get you in my future. So it is.
Leo
Doctor Craig. Doctor DJ Craig.
Craig
Yeah, the D stands for Doctor.
Taylor
J. Stand for.
Craig
DJ Yeah, let&rsquo;s keep that mystery.
Taylor
OK.
Craig
This point. So yes, we&rsquo;re talking here about video games and immersive video games, and some of the skills that we can accomplish from it and potentially how we can put ourselves into video games in a constructive and healthy fashion. We&rsquo;ve got a special guest, Leo. DJ Leo, joined by Magistrate Taylor.
Taylor
And not magistrate magister.
Craig
Ohh I&rsquo;m I just said. That&rsquo;s right. That&rsquo;s my confusion. And we&rsquo;re we&rsquo;re looking for the games unusual ways people have used video games to to do things I. Wanna go through?
Taylor
Surgeon.
Craig
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. No. No. Well, so playing Call of Duty according to the Geneva Convention is my favourite. So this was a classic. It was posted on Kotaku many years ago. Sounds like.
Taylor
Yeah. And you&rsquo;ve and you&rsquo;ve brought it up on this radio about 12 times.
Craig
I know every time. 12 yeah. Yeah. Because I mean, I mean, it sounds like you could do the Geneva Convention and ready or not.
Leo
I&rsquo;ve broken. I&rsquo;ve broken the Geneva Convention one too many times, and really.
Craig
Really. You&rsquo;re amongst friends, Leo. It&rsquo;s OK. And. And plus we&rsquo;ve we, you know, we&rsquo;ve obscured your ruining by saying DJ in. Front of us. Yeah, playing Call of Duty. According to the new Convention, one of my favourite all time video game articles from Kotaku was talking about a dad whose son wanted to play Call of Duty, and the son was like 12 and thought little too early for you. But let&rsquo;s play it together. If you read the entire Geneva Convention 1st and we&rsquo;ll sit down and we&rsquo;ll play the game together and talk about how the Geneva Convention. Can help us? Play it. There was a clip I found actually of someone trying. I don&rsquo;t know if they. Were trying it. There&rsquo;s a lot of clips. When I looked at Geneva Convention Call of Duty, which are people breaking the Geneva Convention, and here&rsquo;s one called. Breaking the Geneva Convention in Call of Duty.
Speaker 8
The Geneva Convention has been broken in Call of Duty zombies and. Here&rsquo;s how. Actually, you can&rsquo;t shoot me. You can&rsquo;t shoot me in Chernobyl, cause apparently it&rsquo;s against Geneva Conventions. So please do not. Show me. Approximately in 13 seconds I will die from radiation poisoning.
Craig
Yep. So that that&rsquo;s pretty much the level of engagement with the Geneva Convention video game YouTube, but this one was, yeah, Dad tried to play it. And of course mainly the Geneva Convention. It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s, you know, once the soldier appears to be surrendering, you can&rsquo;t shoot. OK, which is the problem that many people have found that there&rsquo;s, like there&rsquo;s the no Russia level in cool G4. I think we&rsquo;re basically you&rsquo;re part. Of a US embed in a Russian terrorist cell that then is in an airport. Yeah, you cannot. You can choose not to fire, but basically you know you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re witnessing. Yeah. Yeah. A a complete breach of the Geneva Convention. Pretty.
Taylor
Can.
Speaker
Yeah.
Taylor
Pretty. Shocking that one when I first. Played it, yeah.
Craig
Speed running this type of challenge run in which players attempt to complete a game as quickly as possible. Speed runners often use glitches and exploits to shave off seconds or even minutes from their time. Speed running can be very challenging and rewarding. Have you tried to speed run any games?
Leo
Just received a message, yeah.
Taylor
It says it&rsquo;s cod Modern Warfare 2.
Craig
Oh, is that the one with the no Russian level?
Taylor
Leave say that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re referring. To I think so.
Craig
Yeah, yeah. I mean, it got so much news. It was such an interesting intersection of real world. Nervousness around terrorism and yeah, I mean and very much in Australia at that point where there was a a heavy kind of nerf hammer on video games, there wasn&rsquo;t an R18 classification yet in video games at that.
Taylor
Hmm.
Craig
So people in 80S said the Geneva Convention for losers don&rsquo;t think a healthy conversation.
Taylor
But I think I think it gives sort of like because he&rsquo;s a a kid in school and the the father with his with his kid. So did that kid who his father forced him to play via Geneva Convention? Yeah.
Craig
Oh yeah.
Taylor
Did that kid? Like his father growing up.
Craig
Well, yeah. I mean, yeah, how would you react to your father or your parent if they required you to play the the game coins? Do you mention right? What&rsquo;s what does Chachi PT say for how to?
Taylor
Does he still talk to him anymore?
Craig
Handle that conversation. Speed. Or have you done speed runs? Are you a?
Taylor
Speed runner? Yeah, I&rsquo;ve tried to speed run things.
Craig
Before Sonic the Hedgehog. I didn&rsquo;t think you as a Sonic guy. No, that&rsquo;s.
Taylor
9. Surprising try to speed. Run. Yeah, Yoshi&rsquo;s island.
Craig
You know, she&rsquo;s island. Is that the one like the green Dino? Is that yeah.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
She yeah, yeah.
Taylor
What else have I speed run?
Craig
Actually.
Taylor
I&rsquo;ve never finished Skyrim, ever.
Craig
Really, this is a game we talk about. With you all the time. Yeah. Finished. Minecraft Mike. Well, yeah, you can&rsquo;t finish.
Taylor
Can you finish Minecraft?
Leo
Yeah, you can beat the Ender Dragon.
Taylor
OK.
Craig
Well, maybe one of the challenges for the game, really or not, is is a a no hit. Run right. This type of challenge run, in which players attempt to complete the game without taking. Damage. This can be incredibly difficult and it requires a great deal of skill and practise. Yeah, you&rsquo;ve not been hitting the red.
Leo
I&rsquo;ve done it before. Yeah.
Craig
Do you get an award? Did it pop up?
Leo
No, it was only. It was only on one. It was only on one mission.
Craig
In steam saying. You&rsquo;re just hitting the corner.
Leo
No, I somehow it was on the first level and it was on normal mode. So it was quite easy because I&rsquo;ve done that mission. It&rsquo;s called 4 year gas station and basically it&rsquo;s a bunch of guys are addicted to drugs and they need drug money.
Speaker
That&rsquo;s fine.
Leo
So they decided to rob a gas station and for some reason SWAT gets. Yes, right. So that&rsquo;s the easiest level and I managed not to take any damage and nor did any of my teammates, yeah.
Craig
Big Boy, 80s message and saying the Australian Defence Force is pretty infamous for war crimes as of in the Middle East, with whistleblowers being arrested. I think that&rsquo;s the.
Taylor
That&rsquo;s true.
Craig
Great thing about this conversation for helping. Yeah. Yeah. Well, it&rsquo;s all reflections of real world situation. So we could talk comically about the Geneva Convention and.
Taylor
Bringing it back to.
Craig
And you know how difficult it would be to get beyond the loading screen in Call of Duty to play it. But nevertheless, I mean, it&rsquo;s a good space to ask questions about it. Why? Is it so? Difficult and and should you know should should we require that as a challenge in some first person shooters?
Leo
My teachers keep on getting angry whenever I use the word. Why? Because I use. It way too much.
Craig
Why?
Leo
I just thought I&rsquo;d bring that up because you.
Craig
Used the word why right? Well, yeah. We&rsquo;re to spread all the W&rsquo;s. Who, what? When, why, where, how?
Leo
Yeah. So if you hear any laughing, that&rsquo;s my mom in the.
Craig
Back corner. Yes. Thank you for coming. We we haven&rsquo;t put you on mic yet. I guess that&rsquo;s lucky. Next time how about this with this challenge playing with unusual controllers, this type of challenge run in which plays attempt to complete a game using.
Speaker
Right.
Leo
An unusual control, you know that. Car here. Guitar. Yeah.
Craig
Yeah, yeah, exactly. Using the Guitar Hero guitar. A steering wheel. Right. Anything that&rsquo;s meant for another game, right? So the stern will feature.
Taylor
No, not, not even. Not even really another game cause the one I&rsquo;m thinking of when as soon as you said that was the person that was playing Pok&eacute;mon through. Which no what.
Craig
There&rsquo;s Twitch plays Pok&eacute;mon where the Twitch subscribers to this thing told him how to play it.
Taylor
No, no, no, no, no. Through flute.
Craig
Through flute, like a flute.
Speaker 8
Colinda.
Taylor
Yeah, yeah. And depending on which note it was because they had like a a Raspberry Pi when up, which was linked up to a microphone which took the signal of what key was being played. And then it would then move the character up or down or left, right, AB.
Craig
Wow, we could do the show by the notes I take as the conversation that&rsquo;s created. Like that.
Taylor
So instead of talking, you just play that sounds.
Leo
No.
Taylor
Great. No, I took it. I.
Craig
Took it up to Checchi PT and it would be like that. Would then tried to say you know you must now. Ask the following question on a.
Leo
Imagine imagine, if like you imagine if you&rsquo;re in a gunfight and you just hear.
Speaker 4
Yeah.
Leo
BIM, BIM.
Craig
It&rsquo;s very immersive in this studio. Super Mario Brothers was originally designed to be played with AD PAT, but plays quickly, discovered that they could also use the directional buttons to jump higher. This led to the development of bee hopping. Technique which is used by speedrunners today. The more you know. Legend of Ocarina, Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time.
Speaker
Yeah.
Taylor
Yeah.
Speaker 4
Have you spoken of all?
Taylor
The words in that sentence. Yeah, I&rsquo;ve played that.
Craig
Before this was originally designed to be played in a linear fashion, but players quickly discovered that they could break out of the games. Boundaries and explore the world freely. This led to the development of the Zelda speedrunning community. Dark Souls is a notoriously difficult game, but players have found a number of ways to make it easier. Have you played Dark Souls? This is one of those permadeath games, right? I think it&rsquo;s a recent game like you die and you have to go way back to an early start point. For example for some players. Develop glitch runs where which are completed without using any glitches or exploits. Others have developed, no hit runs.
Taylor
Yeah. I just remember it wasn&rsquo;t Mario. It was Call of Duty, Molly. Yeah. So there was this fellow he was going like PIP and then it would put the the reticle over to the left a little bit. And because he was playing sniper and then he go and then it would shoot.
Craig
Oh crazy. The Sims is another notorious one where people do all manner of bizarre psychosocial experiments on their their SIM creation. Have you played The Sims a bit like Minecraft?
Leo
A little bit. I&rsquo;m also played blocksburg but.
Craig
Blocksburg is that on Roblox? Yeah. Is that one that mine, that media mothership could do an episode in?
Leo
Yeah, I guess, but it&rsquo;s kind of boring.
Craig
We looks get in touch with.
Leo
Us now, yeah, multibillion dollar company.
Craig
0 fortunately. Yeah, they&rsquo;re a friend of the show. I know. There&rsquo;s the controversy around there.
Taylor
We&rsquo;ve lost a lot, man.
Craig
What was it? They. Kept.
Leo
A child psyche.
Craig
Yeah, yeah, they, they, they kicked off. Who who was behaving.
Leo
Schlep schlepp. Badly. No. He he he. Yeah, he was. He was trying to. He was trying to. Yeah. He was trying to. He was trying to arrest paedophiles. And Roblox decided to ban him for quoting, quote, taking conversations off platform and and also failing to report incidents through the correct avenues. OK.
Craig
Ohh he was behaving good, right? He was in crapping paedophiles.
Leo
Reporting it directly to. Blocks.
Craig
I mean, that&rsquo;s a huge own goal. That&rsquo;s a. Huge epic fail.
Speaker
Yeah.
Craig
On a company that&rsquo;s meant to be child safe. Yeah, big boy. Need his message. And saying he grew up on The Sims 3. Because I&rsquo;ve heard I&rsquo;ve heard people.
Taylor
Believe that.
Craig
Have like they&rsquo;ve created like a A a swimming pool or something. Given the people a phobia of water and then removed the letters from the swimming pool and put all the characters in there.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
And just seeing them. You know basically need a therapist.
Speaker
By.
Craig
Feel free to send your confessions, Big boy needy to the chats you&rsquo;ve inflicted in Sims 3. You&rsquo;re amongst friends.
Leo
Anyone else that wants to say any confessions messaging on 04888 is a. 110.
Craig
707 yeah, 0488811707 or jump on the YouTube or Twitch chat. That to send us your thoughts of your own experiences in in gaming.
Taylor
Or if you want to contact Doctor Craig directly, his number is.
Craig
Just cause I said. You&rsquo;re sending money. The the stakes have risen.
Taylor
Yes.
Leo
You can, I say, find out phone number on the top left of the website edgeradio.org dot AU. That&rsquo;s something that I just like including on my shows because it&rsquo;s a lot. Easier for most people.
Craig
It&rsquo;s true. Yeah. If you go to our website or the Edge Radio website WWW.
Leo
Seems like we only. 10 minutes, yes.
Craig
Yeah. Yeah. So we&rsquo;re wrapping up now what video game are you currently playing?
Leo
Yeah. Ready or not?
Craig
Radio knots. Yeah. Yeah, high rotation. I&rsquo;m playing the digital version of a board game, Spirit Island, because I did so badly with it. Yeah, yeah, I tanked it. I tanked it.
Taylor
In real life.
Craig
Right. It&rsquo;s a Co-op game, and if one person doesn&rsquo;t do well, it&rsquo;s kind of like everyone tries to help you. Things like, I feel like there&rsquo;s a. Yeah, I just need some military training to understand. How to get constructive criticism?
Leo
So one quick question, what is your decision? Are you going to Father&rsquo;s Day or are you going to see drawers?
Craig
Right. I got the date. Wrong. Ohh really? Father&rsquo;s Day&rsquo;s not this Sunday. It&rsquo;s next Sunday. I don&rsquo;t know. That&rsquo;s maybe it&rsquo;s my kids trying not to do it for me.
Leo
Oh.
Craig
Dance. Not next, not not this Saturday.
Taylor
Yeah, cause this it must be next it. Must be next 7th.
Craig
Yeah, 7:00.
Leo
That that bang was his phone. Don&rsquo;t worry, guys. No, nothing&rsquo;s going on. No. Ready. Or not stuff.
Craig
What video game are you playing?
Speaker
At the moment.
Taylor
I&rsquo;m going through all of the different rogue likes at the moment, actually.
Craig
Really, rube. So what is the rogue like genre?
Taylor
There&rsquo;s one of those ones where or rogue like rogue like.
Craig
LIGHT, not LIKE.
Taylor
No LOKE&amp;LITE. They&rsquo;re both sort of legit and and people don&rsquo;t really understand the difference between anyway, so it doesn&rsquo;t matter, but it&rsquo;s basically one of those things where you go through iteratively getting stronger through a loop, sort of.
Craig
I was saying like. They&rsquo;re both. Part of the joner.
Speaker
Then.
Craig
Thing. So it&rsquo;s a kind of like you start as a white belt. Friday guy and you get your yellow. Belt.
Taylor
No. You start as a. You start as a white belt karate. Go play the game. Get up to yellow and then you die. So you start back as a white belt karate guy, but you&rsquo;ve got an extra punch. You can do every round, that sort of thing.
Craig
Really. So what games are like these what?
Taylor
Are some of the, well, the the ones I&rsquo;m playing on my phone at the?
Craig
Moment are balatro balatro any balatro players out there, feel free to challenge. Healer during the kicks the the fundraiser, we&rsquo;ll set it up as a. Fundraiser have you ever played?
Leo
That like, is it a board?
Taylor
Game. It&rsquo;s a card game. It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a card card game, sort of. No, it&rsquo;s not all kind of as a deck builder, but it&rsquo;s like a you, you.
Craig
Oh, OK, no. The deck building.
Taylor
Get poker hands. But you then play against the computer just to a pre generated amount, and then you&rsquo;ve got all of these different Joker cards which have got all these different effects right to give you. More, more money. And it keeps getting harder and harder.
Craig
But it&rsquo;s not gambling.
Taylor
It&rsquo;s not gambling.
Craig
Because yeah, yeah, I mean. And one of the things in a future episode, I&rsquo;d love to get on to in media mothership if I can get some research, maybe in neuroscientist on, on the show to interview is video games in the brain, right, the the serotonin that gets released, the dopamine that gets. At least. The no ripping friend. Ohh you know that one.
Leo
No epinephrine.
Craig
So this this, this neurotransmitter is associated with alertness and focus. Video games, especially action packed or competitive ones, can stimulate the brain stress response, leading to increased no RIP.
Leo
No. How do you say it? No preference, no. No epinephrine, no repairin. No, no, no epinephrine, no epinephrine.
Taylor
My my question, my question is so you know how Elon Musk is getting everyone to get mind control through neural link and things like that.
Leo
The next one.
Craig
Isn&rsquo;t it ketamine?
Taylor
Neuralink well you, you you know how.
Craig
OK.
Taylor
You know the Tetris effect.
Craig
Ohh yes yeah. When people see the Tetris puzzle in the real world after they&rsquo;ve played it.
Taylor
Yeah, so, so you, you, you play Tetris for like 5 to 10 hours and then when you close your eyes you can see Tetris. Yeah. Do you reckon in the future that people will be able to hack into your neurolink and then play Tetris in your mind because it&rsquo;s in your mind as your.
Craig
And then suddenly everything. Well, yeah. And I was saying, yeah.
Taylor
Visualising it.
Craig
I mean it does. I mean, it&rsquo;s a shame. We&rsquo;ve only got. 6 minutes left.
Leo
Ready this? Be some pretty interesting things to the quite similar. In fact, I somewhat consider even better than Neuralink, such as like there&rsquo;s this new field called biohacking where you.
Speaker
Boom.
Leo
Quite literally, hack your own body in a way so I&rsquo;ve actually met someone that had a chip inside of their inside of their like webbing between their fun and their. Next finger and basically they allowed them to unlock their house by just tapping their hand up against their front door.
Craig
Yes, yes, it opens up all these questions, doesn&rsquo;t it?
Leo
Yeah, and.
Craig
About audience, yeah.
Taylor
And they say most people regret their tattoos.
Craig
And that&rsquo;s true, yeah. Tattoos as a really. Sorry, reflection on some poor choices in life, let alone and you. Feel like that&rsquo;s. Permanent and then getting a little bio card chip thing on you to to.
Leo
It&rsquo;s just some of the pretty cool things, such as some people have actually. Quite literally, put magnets into their fingers into their ears that they can feel or hear magnetic vibrations and feel electric fields and stuff like that. I found that quite interesting.
Craig
Entirely look, and they do feel that you know, media and technology can fundamentally change and rewire. Mines in really interesting ways.
Leo
I had a. I heard a story about someone that had a a magnetic finger plant inside of their fingers. It cold it between your middle finger and your pinky finger.
Craig
Right, yes, that the ring.
Leo
Finger. Yeah, the ring finger. So they had a magnetic implants, like the ring finger. And as they were going through a through a metal detector, they suddenly started looking around because they felt something and they didn&rsquo;t know what it was. But instead of looking at their finger, they naturally started looking around, indicating that they actually developed a new sense. It wasn&rsquo;t just them feeling that. Their finger was vibrating. They actually thought there was something nearby.
Craig
Them. Yeah, look, and you know, the cochlear implant is.
Taylor
And then three years later, they need an MRI and by by fingers.
Craig
It&rsquo;s very moral panic thing. What we need is messaging to say I would 100% be a neuro link hacker. But if any government officials are listening in, I&rsquo;m definitely joking. So he&rsquo;s in. The clear, yeah. Thank you. DJ Leo, I think this has been very informative. We&rsquo;ve, we&rsquo;ve, we&rsquo;ve ended on such an exciting note in terms of bio engineering and hacking that we&rsquo;ll have to pick that up at a future point.
Leo
Fire.
Craig
Any bio hacker people out? There, feel free to message in 0488811707. Or catch us up on our socials. You can reach out to media mothership on its Facebook page. It&rsquo;s Instagram page. It has a website mediamothership.aunoisthatwrongwhatdidi-say.com.org.org I think. Well, that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s edgeradiois.org dot AU. Yeah, I&rsquo;m not on org though.
Taylor
Well.
Speaker 5
Tonight.
Leo
Tom.
Craig
I don&rsquo;t think I got to come either anyway.
Taylor
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. You are just dot AU because, yeah, you hopped onto that train.
Craig
All the best sheriffs.
Taylor
And nobody else did.
Craig
Fashion. That&rsquo;s distinctive. Listening next week on Media Mothership where we explore. I don&rsquo;t know. I don&rsquo;t know. Knight Rider I&rsquo;m thinking 1980s knight.
Taylor
Rider no, I haven&rsquo;t. Seen that, yeah. The office.
Craig
Thanks. Thanks listeners for listening in Big Boy 80 and so forth. Yeah, maybe yours. And if people are interested in what Leah has been saying, listening on Tuesdays at 11:00 live to.
Leo
You can message Anne. I can answer any questions.
Craig
Hyper fixation sensation. Any other way people can reach out to you?
Leo
Yeah, we haven&rsquo;t finished Ram. I don&rsquo;t know what it is because my co-host Jen runs it. She&rsquo;s my support worker. Do we have any shows?
Craig
After this, no.
Leo
No, that&rsquo;s cool. Yeah. I want to show mum the setup.
Craig
Yeah, there&rsquo;s a lot of junk on the table at the moment. As people will see on the street. All right. Well, thanks everyone for listening and this would be meeting mothership for another week. Doctor Craig joined by Mordecai Taylor, Magister Taylor and GJ.
Leo
Magistrate.

<div class="entry-content alignfull wp-block-post-content has-medium-font-size has-global-padding is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained">
<p>We discuss the &ldquo;East Meets West&rdquo; interview from David Anthony Kraft&rsquo;s Comics Interview (1995) issue 148. An interesting moment in the cultural exchange between Western and Japanese comics, focusing on a visit by American comics creators, including Will Eisner and Brian Stelfreeze, with Tezuka Productions. We delve into the early interactions between Western creators and manga during a time when distinctly Japanese-branded manga and anime were just emerging in the U.S. and Western markets. We also connect these insights to recent developments, including &ldquo;Kadokawa Seeks New Manga Artists Overseas Due to Labor Shortage&rdquo; (Mainichi Japan) and &ldquo;&lsquo;Frieren&rsquo; Staff Warn Against Chasing Western Trends&rdquo; (Bounding Into Comics).</p>

Craig
All right, welcome to. Media mothership here on Edge radio. 99.3 FM.
Speaker
Seth.
Craig
Seth Rollins, that. The through, you know, I&rsquo;m just gonna mash up and put wrestling ends in.
Marcus
I&rsquo;m OK with that. I mean, Seth Rollins is a good person.
Craig
To start with, it is unfortunately he&rsquo;s not in the studio as always, I&rsquo;m host Craig joined by Co host Taylor. Hey, special guest. So and we&rsquo;re breaking down Summer Slam 2025 and various major events recently in the. World of WWE as well. Right. We&rsquo;ll get around to Hulk Hogan, maybe and. The rest will be a surprise as Mark&rsquo;s mind wanders.
Taylor
John Cena.
Craig
Cena.
Marcus
We can&rsquo;t see him.
Craig
Let&rsquo;s start with overall thoughts of what you thought of summer in 25. What what is it is it? Is it a really key moment in the wrestling calendar?
Marcus
Summer Slam is considered the second most important. Premium live event of the year by WWE after Wrestle Mania Mania. Some people actually call it hot wrestle Mania because WrestleMania is on during early spring and summer. Slam is on during late summer.
Speaker
Yes.
Marcus
Over there. Obviously not over here. It&rsquo;s called the biggest part of the summer. And when, when my friends and I watched it, we were all rugged. Up in hoodies and puffer. Jackets. It was pretty good. It was the first ever two night summer slam because usually a premium live event only goes for one night, but because the roster the WWE has right now is really stacked.
Craig
Right, Yep.
Marcus
And Triple H she does the booking. Doesn&rsquo;t like doing 5 minute throw away matches. They have to cause most of the matches will go for around at least 10 minutes. The main event of night two this year went for well over 35 minutes so.
Craig
And is that long? Is that is it was the main event was considered? Kind of like a a great match. 35 minutes.
Marcus
Ohh, people thought this was great, so the main event of summer Slam 2025 was John Cena versus Cody Rhodes 2. Their first matches at WrestleMania and it wasn&rsquo;t very good because it&rsquo;s John Cena&rsquo;s retirement year and his final year as a wrestler. He turned heel, which means he became a villain at the start of the year because that&rsquo;s something he hasn&rsquo;t done in over 20 years. And he wanted to do that before he retired, and it was just a very odd. Ron and had some very mediocre matches.
Craig
Yes, right, right. Because it&rsquo;s so as you&rsquo;re saying, it&rsquo;s come to an end now, right, that he&rsquo;ll run.
Marcus
Yeah. And there was no, there was no great moment where he did a really heroic action. He just came out and smacked down one day, said he didn&rsquo;t want to be a bad guy anymore. And literally that was it. And yeah, it it&rsquo;s a really awkward promo because Cody&rsquo;s in the ring.
Craig
Really.
Speaker
That&rsquo;s the reason.
Marcus
Who is the the main guy right now? He lost the championship to senior and he got at WrestleMania, got it back at summer. Plan, but seeing it comes out has this long and rambling monologue about how someone pressured me into turning evil because he thought it would be good TV. The rock, the rock, Dwayne Johnson who influenced a lot of the storylines up until sort of March of this year and then just vanished. Without a trace.
Craig
Is there a reason why he&rsquo;s vanished? Is there much speculation as to what went down there?
Marcus
Two things. One is that Dwayne Johnson obviously has a really loaded schedule because not only is he an actor, but he also runs multiple businesses and he runs his own product. Company and as Marco Pierre White once said, you cannot criticise a man for going to work.
Taylor
But it&rsquo;s a good quote. It is a good.
Marcus
Quote but also so the the chief content Officer, Triple H who does the booking of WWE right now. He and the rock and don&rsquo;t get along. They haven&rsquo;t gotten along for the 30 years they&rsquo;ve known each other. They&rsquo;re not friends. They don&rsquo;t enjoy working together. And now that Triple H is and the main guy in head of Creative and Dwayne Johnson&rsquo;s the on the board of directors, they clash. And I think the rock just took his ball and.
Craig
Went home. Yeah, right. So. So the sense is that part of John Cena&rsquo;s heel turn heel. Babyface, move. Now is, is that this is an indication that the rocks influences gone gone.
Speaker
Yeah.
Marcus
Thank goodness, because it was. Everyone keeps waiting for him to turn up and he there&rsquo;s no word from him. They haven&rsquo;t even. Him, but the rematch was really good and it was it. It actually starts out with a really brilliant and subtle bit of storytelling, because the basis of seeing his heel turn was that he was going to ruin wrestling. And so instead of the regular like red, white and blue lights in the caricature of him saluting the comes up on the big screen when he does his entrance for the real run, it was just black text.
Craig
Right.
Marcus
Very black screen white text John Cena to indicate he&rsquo;s not messy. Going around, but when he made his interest summer slam, it starts with the black, the black background, the white text and then boom, the lights come up. It&rsquo;s red, white and blue. There&rsquo;s the character of him saluting, and the crowd absolutely exploded. They were so happy to have him as.
Craig
A good guy again caught everyone.
Marcus
By surprise, it didn&rsquo;t catch any everyone by surprise. I think that that decision. Because people were sort of umming and arring after Smackdown going. Is this real or is he actually gonna be a good guy again? But no, no, he&rsquo;s back as a good guy. And so and the rematch with Cody was excellent. It was a street fight. So notice qualifications, no countouts only win by pinfall or sub. Mission and it went with well over 35 minutes. They actually destroyed part of the ring trying to do damage to each other. There was no blood, which I thought was surprising. They had a really good brawl all throughout the the audience that went through the backstage area. There&rsquo;s this brilliant part where there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s an elevator that lifts Cody up as part of his entrance. Seeing a pounds on coat, he hoists him over his shoulders for his finishing move. The attitude adjustment and then goes backstage and comes out of the elevator with Cody still over his shoulders and this demonic grin and. Space. There&rsquo;s just a lot of really good camera movements and just a lot of really good character work as well. The body language of the guys was excellent, seen as body language, as a wrestler is one of his greatest assets because for, for, for years and years and years when he was doing his full time run, the audience would chant at him. You can&rsquo;t wrestle. You can&rsquo;t wrestle, but the way that he carries himself in his body language and his facial expressions are really good at communicating character and telling a story. And that was really on display in.
Craig
The straight fight, it still surprises me. The return to baby face happening so soon, because part of the excitement I guess for John scenes departure was this drama. Attic shift into a bad guy and that this was going to potentially. I mean there were a lot of speculation as how big this could become. You know, could it mean that all the wrestling titles are going to get taken by Cena and he&rsquo;ll he&rsquo;ll have to reset them or something?
Marcus
Or it would have been an interesting story that to follow, he could have unified. Onto the belts, but ultimately, you know, he&rsquo;s been a heel for five months. There&rsquo;s been a lot of discourse online about whether or not it&rsquo;s worked. If anyone&rsquo;s unfamiliar, wrestling is all. It&rsquo;s all scripted entertainment that presents itself. Being it it ohh, it&rsquo;s basically it. It&rsquo;s acknowledged as but as as as as a work of fiction outside of the outside of the premium live events and the TV shows with the TV shows and the premium live events still aren&rsquo;t operate under that mask grade, which is called kayfabe. And ultimately people are not buying it out of universe. They&rsquo;re not buying in and doing, they&rsquo;re still cheering him. He&rsquo;s been a hill. He was a hill for five months and he&rsquo;s only got about 5 months left.
Craig
Yeah. Before he&rsquo;s gone forever. So because you had a couple of memes that were getting generated by the Sinner, he&rsquo;ll turn the little boy. Who was crestfallen but loved being what was the story about the little boy right? He was like one of the events early on with seen as he&rsquo;ll turn.
Marcus
He was a kid in Brussels at the very front row, wearing in John Cena T shirt and John Cena hat, and it&rsquo;s just after the heel turn and seen it calls him out as part of because he comes out and goes. I&rsquo;ve been in an abusive relationship with all of you. People and he singles the kid out and then they just shot at the kid with his mouth hanging open and just staring like a deer in the headlights. And they actually found the kid in interview afterwards. He was like, look, I&rsquo;m aware that this is.
Craig
That&rsquo;s right.
Marcus
All scripted. I thought it was really cool that he involved me in the story.
Craig
And again, yeah, so it was the sense of really generating it. It&rsquo;s a huge impact. And again if if you&rsquo;re listening out there, feel free to send us a message on 0488811707. We&rsquo;re talking with our special guest Marcus about the Summer Slam 2025. We have a message in. On. Steam no one. What is? What is the chat?
Marcus
Steam steam Chat, my favourite messaging service.
Craig
What is that an image of I think.
Taylor
Isn&rsquo;t that YouTube? Yeah.
Craig
That&rsquo;s. OK YouTube. Chat. Are we playing a game by Big Boy Natty? Thanks, Big Boy needy listening in, he says. Good evening, doctor Craig TT.
Taylor
Yeah, that&rsquo;s maybe.
Craig
OK, that&rsquo;s you and special guest Marcus. Listening was playing cyberpunk. Well, I I think this will help. There&rsquo;s no wrestling in Cyberpunk 2070.
Speaker
Wow.
Taylor
7 There&rsquo;s straight fights.
Craig
In fight. Oh, that&rsquo;s. Right, yes you can. You can do street fighting. Yeah. So we&rsquo;re breaking down WrestleMania 2025. Have jumped in, I guess at one of the surprise favourite moment. Elements of night 2, but which is the Cody Rhodes and John Cena? They&rsquo;re both baby faces now. So what&rsquo;s the inward explanation of two baby faces fighting each other?
Marcus
They were fighting over the undisputed belt, which is seen as the most prestigious belt in the company, because Cody is still a full timer and he wants the belt back because he went through so much to get it in universe and out of universe as well and it was orange case if he wanted it back. And there&rsquo;s a brilliant moment and it it&rsquo;s made clear throughout the throughout the fight that it&rsquo;s not.
Speaker
Used to be.
Marcus
It&rsquo;s not personal it they just. It&rsquo;s just who&rsquo;s gonna be the real top dog. And there&rsquo;s a brilliant moment near the end where a big part of Cody&rsquo;s story in universe is he has to learn to be less soft and less forgiving. And there&rsquo;s a brilliant bit where he and I&rsquo;ve never seen this done before. He undoes Part 1 of the one of the ring. I don&rsquo;t even know. Like, like he full on takes a turn. Buckle off the ring and still attached to the ropes, and he starts bludgeoning. Tina with it, really. And the audience was actually booing him for cause. That&rsquo;s such a heel tactic, but it was very much a case. So I have to do whatever it takes to win. But there&rsquo;s a brilliant moment where he hits a bunch of his signature moves on scene and realises that he&rsquo;s about to pin scene her and put him down for good and.
Craig
What are the names of the signature moves?
Marcus
So for Cody, it&rsquo;s one of them is the Cody Carter where he jumps off, he runs towards and jumps off the second rope. And as he&rsquo;s as he&rsquo;s falling, he sort of grabs the other guys head and drops them to the mat.
Craig
The Cody cutter.
Marcus
Yeah, which is similar to the diamond cutter, which is DDP&rsquo;s signature. And the RKO, which is Randy Orton signature. Yeah, he also does the crossroads where he sort of hooks the other guys head underneath his armpit. So they&rsquo;re bent backwards at the knees and sort of flips around. So they slam the head on the mat. There&rsquo;s also the flip flop and fly, which is one of his dad&rsquo;s moves.
Craig
Flip flop and fly.
Marcus
Why? It&rsquo;s basically a bunch of a bunch of close range punches and then starts with him sort of spinning his hands like he&rsquo;s doing a disco dance from his knees as he bends over to the knees. Does that stands up, adjusts his head and then box them with an elbow? Oh gosh, flip the flip flop and fly.
Taylor
Flip flop and fly. Yeah, I knew it was slip, slop and slap.
Craig
Whoops. Slap, slap. See.
Marcus
Both really good marketing campaigns.
Speaker
Yeah.
Marcus
Those are those are the three big ones that you see in every Cody Rhodes.
Craig
And so you&rsquo;re describing a scene in the the match with Scener and Rhodes, where he is roads is doing his signature moves.
Marcus
Yeah. So he the to the, the, the climax of the match. He&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s hit them all scene is. Clearly staggered.
Craig
And I guess the crowds reacting to that as they&rsquo;re seeing these signature moves, each one of those is kind of narratively placed to to create heat or audience engagement. And so Sinner is. Is kind of receiving these moves, and the audiences, the audience.
Marcus
Cody is an interesting one because usually because the the the WWE audience is interesting in that the people, usually the they always dislike the current guy. They almost always dislike the current guy ever since. Yeah, ever since John Cena became the guy in the early 2000&rsquo;s, The people who were going to see him.
Craig
Everything&rsquo;s like the belt holder.
Marcus
Who had the disposable income to pay to go and see senior matches had grown up watching Brett Hart Stone cold and the rock, and they were the three guys. They loved and Sena was not like any of them. And so they would Boo him because they didn&rsquo;t like the way that he was portrayed as a, as a, as a as a hero. They didn&rsquo;t like his style, so they would just he&rsquo;d walk in and they would just absolutely Boo him out of the building. But now, because seeing was always be with kids watching at home. So now the people who are going to the stadiums to see the matches. People who were kids when they watched John Cena 10/15/20 years ago and so now they Boo whoever seen her as fighting cause they he&rsquo;s their childhood hero.
Craig
It&rsquo;s like the attack of the clones movie, you know? Ohh maybe Phantom menace, right? Absolutely horrible movies from ******** Star Wars. And but that was the movie The kids grew up with, and now it&rsquo;s a cherished part of Star Wars, which gets re released.
Marcus
Yeah.
Speaker
Really.
Taylor
I. Even though I thought everyone hated it matter who they were.
Craig
Not not young kids. I mean, I think that was aimed at.
Marcus
8 year olds I I loved phantom menace when I saw it in this and it. Was a nine year old I.
Craig
Saw it twice, right, see and and it&rsquo;s in this nice, warm nostalgic place. Now, if it&rsquo;s at the movies as a.
Marcus
Relaunch or I will say I&rsquo;ve never liked to tackle the clones though. I&rsquo;ve. Always found that. Boring start now, yeah.
Taylor
Me too.
Craig
Come to the converted here.
Marcus
But something that&rsquo;s something to note is that is that Cody is the first guy who&rsquo;s actually like being an organic baby face, who the crowd actually likes because he usually gets the really big cheers like everyone sings, sings his theme song. They get behind everything that he does. They&rsquo;re always cheering for like. Nuts for him. Because from sort of 2002 to him coming back in 2022. The main guys were people who Vince McMahon, the former owner, would just push. He just didn&rsquo;t care what the audience thought cause he was a strange and odd dude, and we have something to say about him in a little bit. A strange and odd dude who just hated his audience for some reason I thought they.
Craig
Were all idiots, but Vince McMahon is the is is the godfather of.
Taylor
The son of the Godfather.
Craig
The space, the sound of it, yeah.
Marcus
Really. No. He McMahon like McMahon. Senior ran a successful run, a successful territory.
Craig
Because we&rsquo;re talking here about the managers and bosses, yeah.
Marcus
Junior.
Craig
Of wrestling, WWF, WWE.
Marcus
Yeah. Insane. You run a run a successful territory, Vince Junior. Who was that? That guy ran a successful global takeover.
Taylor
Fair.
Marcus
Vincent Vincent. Major is human scum. He&rsquo;s an atrocious human being, personally. But he did succeed in making the.
Craig
Bought out.
Marcus
Ohh yeah. Ohh yeah, the one where he&rsquo;s like in tears when he&rsquo;s being asked about what? His what his friendship with. The undertaking. Means he&rsquo;s. Yeah. Because because, well, because. Because he was horribly abused as a kid. He hates any involuntary bodily function. So he hates crying because he can&rsquo;t control it. He&rsquo;s fired people for sneezing in front of him. He hates anything you can&rsquo;t control.
Craig
Gosh, seems like an episode of succession or something.
Marcus
Pretty much is, but there was a really controversial moment from the end of the end of the match, or just after the.
Craig
Match rather. Yep, this is Day 2, the Cody versus. Seen a match.
Marcus
Yes. So it ends with Cody gets the pin. After saluting scene. It looks really sad. He salutes him cause like they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re friends in real life. They&rsquo;re friends in the fictional.
Craig
Saluting Cena. That&rsquo;s.
Speaker
Yeah.
Marcus
Universe and it&rsquo;s like he wants his belt back. He doesn&rsquo;t want his friend, so he pins him. He gets the belt back. There&rsquo;s tears. They hug scene. It gives him the belt. Seen her motions to Cody for the audience to applaud for him. Cody gets out of the ring and let&rsquo;s see now have his moment. The audience is chanting. Thank you, Cena. But then. A wrestler who was one of seen his big rivals throughout his career, his music hits and he comes out and it&rsquo;s Brock Lesnar who? OK. So Vince Junior, who we just talked about who ran WWE for about 4045 years, had to resign because he&rsquo;s being investigated by the feds for running a sex trafficking. Yes, and Brock Lesnar was 100% complicit in that. And there are text messages confirming this and he he&rsquo;s mysteriously disappeared after Mania after summer Slam 2023 with we&rsquo;d never seen him again. And Brock Lesnar comes out and he&rsquo;s here to have one last match against Cena later in the year, and that has inspired opinions online.
Craig
Wow. Yeah. I mean, that&rsquo;s a really. The toxic move to bring.
Marcus
That&rsquo;s someone you do not want, especially considering how many women are in the WWE right now like they&rsquo;re women&rsquo;s roster is the biggest it&rsquo;s ever been. You do not want someone who is involved in a human trafficking organisation. It&rsquo;s difficult to be a wrestling fan at the moment because of stuff like that.
Craig
So who&rsquo;s the who&rsquo;s the target audience for this? I mean, this would have to have gone through some marketing to decide. Alright, well, let&rsquo;s bring. Back he&rsquo;s got the right wing neo-Nazi audience.
Marcus
My my understanding is my understanding is that it was done as a favour to John Cena because Cena Cassina enjoyed working with Brock Lesnar throughout his career and so my understanding is that he&rsquo;s actually requested that Lesnar come back so he can have.
Speaker
Really.
Marcus
One last last match again.
Craig
Even with the bad PR optics I.
Marcus
Could be very wrong. I could be very wrong but. That that&rsquo;s my understanding.
Craig
No. So these, they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re. Yeah. So there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s juicy behind the scenes. Debates and conspiracy.
Taylor
And and for people at home who haven&rsquo;t seen Brock Lesnar, he looks kind of like if he had fantastic fours. The thing as just a human, that&rsquo;s him.
Marcus
If you were to cover if you were to cover a tree like an oak tree trunk in shaved ham, that&rsquo;s Brock Lesnar.
Craig
Wow. Wow. So yeah, look, I mean, it is. It&rsquo;s surprising then that that this, this, I mean polarising figure or this.
Marcus
Seems polarising cause people who grew up watching him are like, yeah, Brock Lesnar&rsquo;s back. And then people who are aware that he is involved in an ongoing human trafficking.
Craig
Just like.
Marcus
It&rsquo;s like, why would you bring him back? That&rsquo;s a really bad. That&rsquo;s bad. Pay off. And they&rsquo;ve they&rsquo;ve gotten bad PR as a result. It&rsquo;s really upsetting.
Craig
Well this I. Mean. I mean, I mean, there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s been some discussion of the the overlap between the Trump administration and WWE. Maybe this is just part of being on the the bandwagon of trying to dig yourself out of implications with sex.
Marcus
Trafficking. Well, I mean, Trump is a WWE Hall of Famer, so I mean, obviously the standards are low.
Craig
By being a Hall of Fame, what does that mean? He&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s a photo of him in a museum. The wrestling museum, yeah.
Marcus
No, he&rsquo;s well, he&rsquo;s been stunned by Stone Cold Steve Austin so that he&rsquo;s technically been he&rsquo;s been part of wrestling manoeuvres. But yeah, so the Hall of Fame happens every year at WrestleMania. Basically. They induct people, they get updated with speech. There&rsquo;s a video package celebrating their life and accomplishments. And yeah, Trump&rsquo;s. A Hall of Famer, he got inducted a few years.
Craig
Ago and that would be like a university giving an honorary degree to Shane Warne or something, right? Like it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a way of.
Marcus
Absolutely.
Craig
Of of ensuring political links as well as. You know real. Wrestlers being recognised, but it also has a heavy political. Space. It&rsquo;s wrestling, right wing, conservative.
Marcus
It would be it&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s a that&rsquo;s a. That&rsquo;s a question there have been periods where it&rsquo;s been extremely conservative. So during the war.
Craig
Or.
Marcus
Terror. They had a character played by an Italian American called Mohammed Hassan. One who wears extremely stereotypical Middle Eastern clothing and his he was he. He was a bad guy. No, not not the Sheikh, it&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s the farmer from the Sheikh. He was playing a character who was he was a villain cause he was upset at how much anti Islamic sentiment there was following the War on Terror. And that&rsquo;s why he was a bad guy. And so a lot of people these days pretend that that never happened. There have been a lot of really questionable depictions of LGBTQIA plus people. The character gold dust was basically created to tap into gay panic in the mid to late 1990.
Craig
Wow. So at the height of the AIDS crisis, height, but certainly within that.
Marcus
Yeah, well. They have this very androgynous character in a body suit who licks his lips and lusts openly, lusts after the other men on the roster, and it&rsquo;s just.
Craig
Well, your decade was.
Marcus
That nine this was like 969798, it&rsquo;s.
Craig
Right, right, right.
Taylor
Has Joe Biden in the Hall of Fame? Has he ever had an attitude adjustment?
Craig
Are there any? Yeah, left wing progressive.
Marcus
Ohh look though, I mean Mohammed Mohammed Ali is in the the Hall of Fame.
Craig
The wrestling. Yeah, right.
Marcus
Because he&rsquo;s he was the I think he was a guest enforcer, the guest ring announcer? No, the I think it was a referee for the for main event. Marissa Mania 1. He was involved in that.
Speaker
See.
Taylor
Yeah, it&rsquo;s good referee. Yeah.
Craig
Because Hulk Hogan. Of course, notoriously at the end of his life, promoted and campaigned for Trump. Yep, and a lot of that came up in his obituaries as a some people head scratching kind of identity shift. So within these, did you?
Marcus
Just just on the note of that, after Hulk Hogan passed away, the Wrestling Observer newsletter, which is seen as being sort of the foremost weekly publication wrestling in the world, the the the week he passed away, they did a Life and Times issue and the following week they actually reported on some of the responses his death had gotten online. Because Hulk Hogan was, he was recorded saying some extremely racist things that got leaked, and he&rsquo;s also, you know, a Trump supporter, A notorious backstage politicker. Obviously, he helped make wrestling really big in the 80s, but also.
Speaker
So.
Marcus
Generally speaking, bit of a sketchy guy, scrappy, strange, strange history with his family and basically anyone who said any public figure who said anything about Hulk Hogan would get criticised by someone in the weeks after he passed away. If you were progressive and you said that he had a complicated legacy because of his racism and the way he treated his family, you&rsquo;d get flamed by his fans saying you don&rsquo;t know your wrestling history, there wouldn&rsquo;t be a WrestleMania.
Taylor
Yeah, here&rsquo;s a moustache.
Marcus
If it wasn&rsquo;t for him, whereas if he was lauded by people who are mega fans and appreciated things that he done done for the the the industry, then you&rsquo;d have progressives saying he was a racist. Then he was a political and he was terrible to his family. You you. You shouldn&rsquo;t be celebrating his accomplishments. And I&rsquo;m. I&rsquo;m not saying that either of those are correct or incorrect statements, but he just the amount of vitriol that was directed towards anyone who said anything about him in the weeks following his death was astounding.
Speaker
Hmm.
Taylor
That he&rsquo;s just Twitter as well.
Marcus
Twitter. Some some people actually got some people got bullied off social media like Joey Swoll, who&rsquo;s thing is he&rsquo;s on Instagram and he basically tries to have really positive messages to people and tried to dispel, like any toxic beliefs said that he was a huge fan of Hulk Hogan and people flamed him with within an inch of his life. And he actually quit Instagram for a few days.
Taylor
Yeah.
Speaker
Next.
Marcus
Like I can&rsquo;t take it. Gun.
Craig
Because he said he was a.
Marcus
Fan because he said he was a fan of Hulk Hogan growing up.
Craig
And the backlash to that?
Marcus
Was from, from, from, from progressives who were like he was a racist. He was a terrible human. You can&rsquo;t say stuff like this.
Craig
Because I guess one of the other aspects of Hulk Hogan&rsquo;s past I&rsquo;d forgotten about was his involvement in the Gorka. The scandal with the sex tape and how that complete I&rsquo;ve forgotten about the media systems that basically dismantled the payout was huge. Yeah, I forget how.
Marcus
Ohh yeah. Many it was 115,000,000 that the courts ordered to him. He I think he I believe he settled for 32,000,000.
Craig
Millions, but. And I&rsquo;m 15 really well. Because it was a defamation case, I imagine, and it was because they&rsquo;d.
Speaker
Yeah.
Craig
Used the sex footage that had leaked, OK.
Marcus
I believe it was the footage of him saying how much he hates African Americans that.
Craig
Got leaked? Ohh right it was. That. And anyway, that that that resulted in the collapse of that media platform and that rippled throughout a lot of other platforms. Even Kotaku, you know that there was not a, Kotaku told the journalist, was just saying, you know. He was there, involved not in Gawker but adjacent media publishing company, and was shocked at the ripples that created. So OK. That&rsquo;s Hulk Hogan, so storyline. So we&rsquo;ve we&rsquo;ve gone through a little bit of the storylines in terms of. Sena. What are some of the ongoing storylines which are are kind of becoming compelling at the moment or which we&rsquo;re seeing emerge now or or getting wrapped?
Marcus
Up one story that&rsquo;s had a a a curveball that was really well done is so the whole. The the Seth Rollins CM Punk feud, which has been going off and on since CM Punk came back in late 2023. For reference, CM Punk is someone who was he? He left WWE in 2014 under a cloud of controversy, spent the next nine years saying very negative things about them and then was welcomed back with open arms. Seth Rollins, basically. That the ball from him is being one of the top guys and has never had a nice thing to say about punk in real life or in kayfabe. And essentially, there&rsquo;s a story been going on between them for a while now. They had they had a triple threat match at WrestleMania, which ended with Seth Rollins turning heel. Even the audience loves him, became a bad guy, and he started his own faction called The Vision. And this is brilliant. So they so LA night, who was another guy who people. Really like him. And it&rsquo;s really it&rsquo;s basically do or die time either because he&rsquo;s 42, he&rsquo;s not getting any younger either they. No, he&rsquo;s 40. Sorry. Either they strap the rocket to him and make him one of the top guys or he&rsquo;s gonna flounder in the mid kite for forever cause even though.
Speaker
Right.
Marcus
Wrestling is premeditated. People only have so much time that they can be in the main event, and it&rsquo;s got you&rsquo;ve gotta capitalise because it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s week to week. There is no offseason for wrestling and he&rsquo;s he challenged Seth Rollins to a match at Saturday night&rsquo;s main event and during the match Seth has a history of knee injuries. He did WrestleMania last year on a torn meniscus. He was working on one leg and he had two matches across the weekend, plus a run in and then he had several months off for surgery during the match at Saturday night&rsquo;s main event.
Craig
Ouch.
Marcus
Broadcast live on NBC because normally wrestling&rsquo;s done either on a streaming service or cable, he does his knee and he very and this is brilliant. He he he injured his knee. He looks terrified and he very clearly motions over to the referee and you can clearly see him telling her go and tell Ellie night to pin me. Done my knee. I can&rsquo;t keep doing the match. So he&rsquo;s called. He&rsquo;s called an audible. That&rsquo;s what that&rsquo;s called. Because if you can&rsquo;t continue with the match, you&rsquo;ve got to communicate to the other person and say, here&rsquo;s what we have to do. And so Seth Rollins is then on crutches. There&rsquo;s word he&rsquo;s gonna be out for six or seven months. And here&rsquo;s the thing. Seth Rollins won money in the bank, which basically means that if you have the money, the bank briefcase whenever you want, you can open it and you can, if you pin the tile, you can. You can get an immediate title match no matter where you are or where you are. And it&rsquo;s always done on TV, even though there&rsquo;s so many other hours in the week because it&rsquo;s WWE and. Their their universe is interesting, but essentially so. There was talk about how how they&rsquo;re going to do this when he&rsquo;s going to be out until next year. Yeah. And then there&rsquo;s much the night 1 main event is CM Punk, his rival versus Gunther dead in general, whose thing is that? He&rsquo;s Hitler. And he Gunther has the World Heavyweight Championship, which is the main belt on Roy. It&rsquo;s the secondary world title of the promotion. And it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s an exhausting.
Speaker
MHM.
Marcus
Match Punk is on his knees, gassed for most of it, and it&rsquo;s clearly done in storyline that he&rsquo;s really exhausted fighting Gunther and he basically, Gunther&rsquo;s only been pinned 3 times in the since he&rsquo;s gone to W. Anyway, and he punk basically makes him bleed for the first time he sends him over the announcers desk. Good. That comes back with his face covered in blood, cause he&rsquo;s done a. Really impressive blade. Job play Joe Punk gets him back in the ring, pins him clean as a whistle. He&rsquo;s got the World Heavyweight championship. It&rsquo;s his moment and then Seth theme music hits Seth.
Craig
&lsquo;S right.
Marcus
Comes out on crutches, throws the crutches away, undoes his leg brace, prances around, pulls out his briefcase, sprints to the ring, pins punk for the 123 and now says the. Heavyweight champion. And the following Rd. The first person to come out and start mouthing off during during a word battle and challenge for a title fight is Ella. Knight. That guy who he injured his knee again to quote unquote. And they have a match later that night that ends in his qualification cause CM Punk gets involved. So this whole punk and LA night are both going after Seth and they are going to feud with each other at. Some point soon.
Craig
Right. Wow.
Marcus
And this storyline is juicy. This has been probably the second best storyline of the year in my estimate, because it&rsquo;s been going for so long through so many permutations. There are so many people involved. The faction that that&rsquo;s built is brilliant the other.
Speaker
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Marcus
Man, sorry. So that&rsquo;s that. And that&rsquo;s really cool. This other thing, which is really funny, is that one of the other top guys, Roman Reigns, he he&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s often out for months at a time. 1 of Seth henchman. Bronson Reed hits this, he he he speared Roman Reigns so hard in an episode of RAW that Roman Reigns his. Shoes came off.
Craig
That means I think. You&rsquo;ve.
Marcus
Died. And then what he does is Bronson Reed, who&rsquo;s a villain. Roman Reigns is a good guy. Bronson Reed steals these really nice Air Jordans, ties the laces together, and he starts wearing them around his neck. And because Roman Reigns, he&rsquo;s Samoan. He was. His role was the try, his his character with the tribal chief who&rsquo;s got this really nice red shell necklace called the ULA Fala. And so now Bronson Reed with these stolen shoes wears them around his neck, and they&rsquo;re the Shula Fala and the audience chants at him and everything. And it&rsquo;s brilliant.
Craig
Crazy.
Marcus
And so just just the fact that a pair of air. Ordnance has become this massive symbol of disrespect is.
Craig
Brilliant. And that would be a real. Surprise movement shoes flying off.
Speaker
Yes.
Craig
And then the wrestler being able to improvise a total amount of that.
Marcus
I don&rsquo;t know if it was improvised or not because people, but I mean people have been actually knocked out of their shoes before, so it wouldn&rsquo;t surprise me, but they had A tag match. Bronson Reed, sorry. Bronson Reed and Roman Reigns had a match against each other with other people involved at at summer slam. It was also really good. Lot of comedy in that match. There&rsquo;s a lot of really good comedy in WWE.
Craig
Right.
Marcus
Right now, but the yeah, the the punk night, Rollins conflicts coming out of me is one of the best ones. That that was a really enjoyable moment, and especially because they had played this fake injury, cause they&rsquo;re usually very clear. They&rsquo;re usually very clear about what is fake and what is real. It&rsquo;s.
Craig
Yeah, right. Someone was playing as.
Marcus
Just. Real they were playing it as real because people have been injured and they&rsquo;ve had to just stop batches this year and some, like there&rsquo;s one where I think it&rsquo;s Zoe Stark comes off a rope. The person she&rsquo;s called out to has noticed and she lands, finding her knees pointing a different angle. Uh. That was against.
Craig
Again and again the the wrestler would get the referee to help communicate.
Marcus
Yes, thankfully that was a triple threat match. So she left the other two kept on brawling and then and that was that was Kyrie saying who was involved in that. And then a couple weeks later, Kyrie saying having a match against Liv Morgan does a perfectly safe headlock. Take down and live. Morgan dislocates her shoulder. And so poor old Kyrie saying has now injured two people in the space of a fortnight and she. So they&rsquo;re both out of the rest of the year. So and because Seth&rsquo;s knee problems, his real life knee problems are so well documented that everyone thought it was real, I thought it was real. I got sucker. We got worked, brother. And so the fact that they were able to, he actually talked about in interviews about how he had to, because he was obviously he was fine at home. He&rsquo;s got a four year old daughter and he said to his daughter, we have to pretend that daddy&rsquo;s got a Boo Boo on his knee. Every I gotta make believe people need to believe this. So of course she immediately went to play school and told her teacher. About it.
Craig
And my dad said we have to make out. My dad&rsquo;s going to. What did you mean by you got worked? Is that a wrestling parlance for effectively being?
Marcus
As in. In, in wrestling work is, it&rsquo;s part of the script. Shoot is. It&rsquo;s real, right?
Craig
So by saying you&rsquo;re worked it was. A scripted moment.
Marcus
And we believed it.
Craig
That it it played as real and it was designed to play as real effectively, but it was actually setting up key fabe, yes. Lane story building. Because yes, that that would be fantastic. I&rsquo;m on the other storylines. How&rsquo;s the Australian talent?
Marcus
Ohh Ria bloody Ripley.
Craig
Because she was on night 1.
Speaker
Some.
Marcus
She was she opened night two night and and ah, because you know that triple threat match from the side of night 2 of WrestleMania earlier in the year. Yes. Similar thing where. She had an absolute bond burner at evolution, which was the second all women&rsquo;s premium life. And against the then world champion EO Sky that ends in Naomi, who had money, the bank major villain comes out, cashes in, gets CEO&rsquo;s title because they&rsquo;re doing this whole bit about how Rio Ripley&rsquo;s Rio Ripley has never beaten Neo Sky, and she still hasn&rsquo;t.
Craig
Right. Sky right. That&rsquo;s the Japanese wrestler.
Marcus
Yes, considered one of the great and. Man ohh sorry I have to have a little rant here. I understand that the the last 40 minutes has not been nothing but me ranting, but Triple H is really bad at booking champions to defend their titles. So there was a brilliant story just before Mania where here sky Beats Rear Ripley for the belt on raw. Very rare to see. A well titled Change Hands on an episode of TV. Usually it&rsquo;s a premium live. Based on in Kayfabe, a match that Ria suggested, she then defends it the following week and then she successfully everyone thought because there was a triple threat. Osmania with RIA and iOS Sky and another wrestler, Bianca Bel Air, everyone thought EO Sky was going to lose it cause she was the 3rd wheel on the feud. Everyone was disrespecting her. She pulls out this incredible win five Star match from the Wrestling Observer newsletter. Brilliant. Feel good. Brilliant. Feel good moment. She then does not defend the belt once.
Craig
Well, it&rsquo;s like.
Marcus
Between late April and when she loses it in mid July.
Craig
Really so just wasted storyline.
Marcus
Completely all there are so many women on that roster who she could have had really good title defences against, even if it&rsquo;s only on TV and not on Premier Live event, but they just didn&rsquo;t do it. She had non title matches, she was in tag team matches but they just didn&rsquo;t.
Craig
I know you&rsquo;ve mentioned in the past that you know Vince McMahon never knew what to do with someone who didn&rsquo;t speak English effectively as a wrestler. Is that partially to do with it still, sadly.
Marcus
Yeah. Or I wouldn&rsquo;t. I wouldn&rsquo;t say so. Because she&rsquo;s had incredible. She&rsquo;s had she, her previous world title run, which was a last year. It went for the best part of eight months. That was actually really good. And she had a number of feuds, feuds rather, and another of the new, one of the there are a couple of talent at the moment who aren&rsquo;t native English speakers, but one of the biggest wrestlers right now, Stephanie Vaquer. She was on NXT, which is the developmental brand, she&rsquo;s Chilean. She doesn&rsquo;t speak much English, but she had a really good run.
Speaker
Hmm.
Marcus
On as champion, actually a double champion, she had the world title and the North American title, so that&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s definitely.
Craig
Because it is. Changed. Yeah, it is exciting with the kind of lucha Libre style from Mexico and then the Japanese wrestling style. So, so definitely giving those global wrestling identities. Coverage in WWE can&rsquo;t help but benefit it, but yeah, it is. Unfortunate that. So anyway, in summer slam there was the match with rear and ear. And was that a good match was.
Marcus
That good? Yes, it was. Rear versus euro versus Naomi, who&rsquo;s sort of the main villain of the women&rsquo;s division at the moment. It was a good triple threat match. Naomi retained because she has a match against Stephanie.
Speaker
It was.
Marcus
Occur at the care at Clash in Paris later. This month and. If Stephanie occurs A babyface, people really like her. If you were to have her go against Rhea Ripley, people would start to Boo her, so she has to go against a mega heel so that people still like her. It&rsquo;s an interesting I actually got to thinking though, because they&rsquo;re gonna have crown jewel, one of the major premium live events in Australia this year. And so I.
Craig
Really, it&rsquo;s coming to Australia, it&rsquo;s. Wrestling.
Marcus
Yeah, it&rsquo;s normally in Saudi Arabia, but it&rsquo;s gonna be in. WA this year.
Craig
Wow, what&rsquo;s stray?
Taylor
Is there? There was already one in WA at some point.
Marcus
Wasn&rsquo;t there? That was elimination chamber last year.
Craig
Wow, OK, so this is happening in Australia. What&rsquo;s the hype for it? Are you excited? Are.
Taylor
Chamber, yeah.
Craig
You got your tickets, are you?
Marcus
Tickets are like 5000 bucks. Man, I&rsquo;m.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
Not going and it&rsquo;s just five audience for this.
Speaker
Easy.
Craig
It&rsquo;s not the legal or it&rsquo;s the rich local.
Marcus
Wrestling at the moment is it&rsquo;s in its third major boom period. Third major global boom period after the after the rock and wrestling era in the 80s and the Attitude era in the late late 90s, early 2000s. And there are a lot of people who were huge fans in Australia and there would be a market to fill up a a 100,000 person stadium there, not before they did it for. Nation chamber because it&rsquo;s what, 22?
Craig
Million people, certainly a market, but it&rsquo;s.
Marcus
Expensive. Ohh, it&rsquo;s. And that&rsquo;s the reason why they one of the reasons why they post that every every single show they do is they&rsquo;re most profitable ever because they just Jack up the prices to diculous levels. They are so expensive it&rsquo;s $500 to sit in the gods. I&rsquo;m not sitting at the back of the stadium for 500 bucks.
Craig
Why is it so? Really. Yeah. Managed meeting.
Marcus
And travelling to Westminster, no. No, no, no. Wow.
Taylor
But they but they had the really big stars coming to Australia as well for that one, it wasn&rsquo;t just. Like randoms or like the lowest ones, it was the highest ones as well. That&rsquo;s why the price.
Marcus
Is so big. Yeah. And scene is gonna be at the WA one as. Well.
Taylor
Yeah.
Marcus
He&rsquo;s gonna be at crown.
Craig
Right, I said.
Marcus
Jewel. OK.
Craig
Sorry guys, it&rsquo;s going to be huge events. It&rsquo;s going to be enormous, but it&rsquo;s unlikely to be something that apart from if you enter a competition. You&rsquo;ll be able to.
Marcus
Get into it all depends about how and how much you&rsquo;re doing, I suppose. Yeah. I mean, I.
Craig
Space.
Marcus
I could afford it though. I just.
Craig
Is this? I mean is it gonna have a stream flavour to it? Are we gonna have? Rio Ripley appearing and recruiting for we&rsquo;re gonna have a little legal talent.
Marcus
Well, she was the main event at the last one that they had cause normally at the elimination chamber, because that&rsquo;s a six person match. Normally the men&rsquo;s elimination chamber would be the main event, the one that goes on last. But no, when when it was in WA last it was her defending her title and she was she went on last so I reckon she&rsquo;ll get the title.
Speaker
Yeah.
Marcus
Back at. At Crown Jewel in WA, because if she gets the title back in her home country, the pop is going to be enormous, people are going to go wild.
Craig
She&rsquo;s 8. Well, well, the Australian tourism body be kind of jumping on this and attempting to promote crocodiles or something. Or like like.
Taylor
So do you mean like bluey and hammer?
Craig
Bar. Yeah. And someone in a bluey costume. I wonder what those soft power optics will be.
Taylor
This is going to be some sort of.
Craig
For and like you know you got Formula One, you got various global sporting events that come to Australia. Australia works hard to secure and then sometimes states compete with each other to get those rights like Formula One was in Adelaide. And then no one wanted.
Taylor
If we had a stadium, they could do. It here. That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m.
Craig
Thinking should we speak?
Marcus
Ma&rsquo;am.
Craig
Local PM about that stadium and wrestling.
Marcus
I gotta say it&rsquo;s sad that Jake the snake Roberts is with AW because, like, think of all the all the Australian snakes you could handle if.
Speaker
Oh.
Marcus
He was your WA.
Craig
OK. So the other thing when I was doing homework for the episode was I came across some discussion of some of the things that didn&rsquo;t go according to plan at at the show. Oh no. I know there was some disappointment. That the what is it? The cable ties didn&rsquo;t work on one of the.
Marcus
Events. Yeah, there was a sequence in the Lyra of Alqueria versus Becky Lynch match, where Lynch pulls out a toolbox because it&rsquo;s notice qualification pulls out zip. Ties cable ties Larry Valkyries hands together. They&rsquo;re obviously very loosely tied, but you know it&rsquo;s you. Understand what I&rsquo;ve done it. And there&rsquo;s a bit where her hands just come out of the cable ties and she just freaks out and puts them back in.
Speaker
Hmm.
Craig
And what would you I mean? To keep the K. 5 Going you want to try to do it off camera? Yeah. But she was on.
Marcus
Camera, right. She&rsquo;s Laura. Valkyria is quite is. She&rsquo;s it. It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s only her first year on the main roster, so she&rsquo;s not used to.
Craig
Right.
Marcus
Revising was what she should have done. She should have just gotten out of them and, you know, called Becky over and they could redo the sport or something along those lines. But basically.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
She didn&rsquo;t wanna not follow the script. Yeah. And is that also the kind of anxiety in the fandom around that do is that kind of like, wow, you know, this is the problem with with wrestling. Now it&rsquo;s all on script or something. Is there a debate? Around what that reflects.
Marcus
Absolutely. That&rsquo;s 100% a complaint that a lot of modern, a lot of older fans have that have with that in the modern era.
Craig
30 years ago this, or 40 years ago, this would be.
Speaker
Yeah.
Marcus
It used to be you&rsquo;d write out a couple of like major story beats and then you&rsquo;d just improvise everything in the ring. One of the really famous examples of that happening is Summer Slam 1992, the Intercontinental Championship between Bret Hart and Davey Boy Smith, his brother in law, Davey Boy Smith had just come off all week long crack binge and he was on a massive crack cocaine downer and he pulls Bret Hart over in front of 92,000. People and he goes. Brett, I&rsquo;m fooked. I can&rsquo;t remember the March and Brett Hart goes. Don&rsquo;t worry about it. DV. I&rsquo;ll carry you. Just follow my lead. Hey. And so Brett Hart literally. Has to. There are so many that match is like at like a 9 1/2 out of 10 near perfect match considered the greatest Summer Slam match of all time. But there are so many rest holds because Brett Hart has to keep reminding Davey Boy Smith what he has to do next. And then Davey Boy wins at the end so hard.
Craig
Right.
Marcus
Carried that man and.
Craig
Yeah. Yeah. So any other surprise moments or things in the summer slam?
Marcus
There was 1 moment. So there&rsquo;s a wrestler carrying cross and his wife Scarlett Bordeaux. Both of them have been on the roster for a while. They haven&rsquo;t really had too many matches recently cause Carrie&rsquo;s basically The thing is, he&rsquo;s the corrupter. Right. His thing is he shows up and he&rsquo;s he&rsquo;ll try to corrupt a baby face and he will have his hair done in their hairstyle. That&rsquo;s his thing. And it&rsquo;s been knowledge all year that his contract is coming to an end and he&rsquo;s good mates with a lot of people on the roster. And so they tried to give him a really big push and give him some major matches on PL E and the fans have responded to this quite nicely and they were actually throughout the his math throughout other matches changing we want. Cross we want cross and in the post show. True, Triple H said. Did you hear those saying we want Brock? We want Brock and carrying cross and skull board. Those contracts expired earlier this week and they&rsquo;re not being rehired. They&rsquo;re now in the alumni section on the website. And so Triple H is actually no last week rather so trips is trying to basically convert the narrative of the audience calling out for carrying. Just to get rehired and say, oh, it&rsquo;s about Brock Lesnar. And so that was.
Craig
Not quite. All right, hold on the stream. &lsquo;S going weird.
Taylor
It is I&rsquo;m. I&rsquo;m just trying to. I&rsquo;m just trying to figure out if it&rsquo;s behind or. Anything that&rsquo;s cool.
Speaker
What?
Marcus
Ohh I&rsquo;ll tell you. I&rsquo;ll tell you a surprise that I had the Becky versus Valkyria match that we talked about just before the the intercontinent the the, the women&rsquo;s intercontinental about where the you know the the the zip tie is not working. Yes, I thought because that was their third match and I thought for certain that Laura Valkyrie was going to win that cause she was the hero with the feud. Ohh. Green screen.
Craig
I&rsquo;ll put my laptop camera.
Marcus
As I thought the entire few because she was the inaugural champion, they they had a. Match. She beats Becky. They have a rematch. Becky beats hers. So this is the third match after a triple threat match at evolution, which had Bailey in it as well. Who&rsquo;s the 3rd member of this story? Essentially. And I thought for certain liars gotta win. Baby face comes out on top now because she&rsquo;s very new. But he&rsquo;s been around for a very long time. Surely she&rsquo;ll come out on top. She&rsquo;ll be a made woman. And then Becky Lynch won IW. What that I did not expect. So we have we have our we have our bad guy wins ending and Becky is going to continue to terrorise the rest of the women&rsquo;s division. I thought I did not.
Craig
Expect that at all. So in terms of what&rsquo;s happening next in WB, what&rsquo;s the next big thing that we should start getting ready for?
Marcus
Clash in Paris, 31st of August.
Craig
Oh, that&rsquo;s in.
Marcus
Paris, yes. Which is really the 1st of September for us. So the confirmed matches thus far are John Cena versus Logan Paul.
Craig
Really, Logan? Paul. Logan. Paul.
Taylor
Wow, nice.
Craig
I mean, he&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s fit, right. He&rsquo;s not there as a joke.
Taylor
He said, yeah, he&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s pretty good at it.
Marcus
The man is a. The man is a superb performer. He&rsquo;s. Great athlete.
Craig
Yeah. And he is, of course, going to play a hero or he is a hero. He&rsquo;s the bad guy.
Marcus
He doesn&rsquo;t. Yeah. Yeah, he doesn&rsquo;t play a heel. He is heel.
Taylor
Yeah.
Marcus
So they they&rsquo;ve thrown it.
Craig
Well, that&rsquo;s a big that&rsquo;s. You know, reflects on how Big Luke and Paul is. I guess that he&rsquo;s given this match against Cena in his last year.
Speaker
OK.
Marcus
Yeah, it&rsquo;s like and it&rsquo;s because one of the criticisms about criticisms about seeing his retirement tour is that he&rsquo;s mostly fighting guys he fought 1015 years ago. Yeah. So the it&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s only had a couple of matches against the new talent and this is the most new talent he&rsquo;s had a match against because generally speaking, it&rsquo;s an unwritten rule for wrestlers that you lose your last match.
Craig
Really.
Marcus
Against younger talent to make them look.
Craig
Good. Who do you think that&rsquo;s gonna get set up?
Marcus
For this year, I could not tell you. All I know is that scene as last match is gonna be in Boston. It&rsquo;s gonna be a Saturday night main event, so it will be broadcast on NBC and YouTube. And I think if he loses in Boston, then there&rsquo;s. Going to be a riot.
Craig
Alright. Right. So they might have to not go to convention.
Marcus
Yeah, because there are. There are very few times where a wrestler will win their their final match. I mean there was the match that stone cold had against Kevin Owens a couple of years ago. It was Stone Cold&rsquo;s first match in 19 years and he won because it was in Texas. And if he had lost, there would have been a riot and. Someone would try to kill Kevin Owens. Sting won his retirement match, but that was mostly because he&rsquo;d spent 35 years getting messed around by terrible creative. Goldberg lost his retirement match in Atlanta to Gunther earlier in the year, and then it was a terrific match. Then he went online and criticised it because NBC cut off his retirement speech. Like, bro, it&rsquo;s on YouTube. Just go to the WWE channel. Just be grateful you gotta retire the match. Be grateful you gotta retire the match, unlike. Bret Hart, whose career you ended when you nearly kicked his head.
Craig
Right. It&rsquo;s.
Marcus
But sorry, straying from the point of the matches that are going to be there, that&rsquo;s going to be fatal four way for the World Heavyweight Championship, which is gonna, which is the main belt on raw, it&rsquo;s going to be between Seth Rollins, he&rsquo;s got the belt, CM Punk, LA Night and.
Craig
This is the big one. You&rsquo;re just setting. Up the storyline.
Marcus
And also Jay USO, who had the belt earlier in the year and everyone loves him because of his theme song and they&rsquo;re setting up Cody Rhodes versus Drew McIntyre. Drew McIntyre is one of the best performers they have is he is a monster heel in the ring. He basically he&rsquo;s a Scottish warlord, essentially.
Taylor
True.
Marcus
And he he&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s built like a brick house. He&rsquo;s got the evil beard, the menacing eyebrows. He just looks like a bad guy. But he&rsquo;s also, like, extremely funny. So he&rsquo;ll just like.
Speaker
But. It&rsquo;s true.
Taylor
Well, it&rsquo;s this.
Craig
Costume at the moment is it is it? Kind of mediaeval Scottish cute.
Marcus
Probably. Basically looks like the bad boy love interest in a mediaeval isekai young adult. Novel, yes, true.
Taylor
Sorry.
Marcus
Yeah. And he&rsquo;s just hilarious because he&rsquo;ll be the savage in the ring, and then he&rsquo;ll just say ridiculous things. In his problem is there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s the moment where senior and Cody bury the hatchet and make friends on smack down. He just comes out and goes. No, you hang up. No, you hang up and it&rsquo;s just. Come on, man. He just he&rsquo;s just got got a very dry wit. And also 70. Stephanie Baker versus Naomi for the women&rsquo;s world. Championship, which is the Royal Women&rsquo;s Belt. So those are the three four matches that we&rsquo;ve got so far. Yeah. Cody Rhodes versus Drew McIntyre isn&rsquo;t confirmed, but it&rsquo;s probable.
Craig
Right. And that&rsquo;s in Paris in Paris? Patty. Right. So again, it would be fun to are there any Paris performers at the moment?
Marcus
Any French performers?
Speaker
Yeah.
Craig
I&rsquo;m imagining someone in a mine costume dresses, right?
Taylor
Yeah.
Marcus
Look, most of the performers are. There are a few Irish performers, a few Aussies, a lot of Japanese and South American performers. But I don&rsquo;t think there are any from France at the moment. They have been in the past, but not right. Now.
Craig
Alright. Our final thoughts on wrapping up how summer slam and upcoming matches are going to evolve.
Taylor
In 40 seconds or less.
Craig
20 seconds or less so.
Marcus
I enjoyed summer slam, but there even better pay per views. It wasn&rsquo;t as good as evolution which. Was.
Craig
Incredible. All right, we have a message for you that you can answer.
Taylor
Yeah, yeah, it just is really off topic. But can I put can you put me as a reference on their resume? That&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re asking. And sure they can be put as a reference.
Speaker
Yeah.
Craig
Fantastic, helping helping the world out here on media.
Taylor
I&rsquo;ll do that.
Craig
I&rsquo;ve been your host, Craig, joined by co-host Taylor.
Taylor
Yep, there&rsquo;s 5 seconds. Come on, man.

<p>We discuss the 1995 &ldquo;What is Anime and Why Is Everybody Talking About It?&rdquo; article from Comics Interview #148 magazine. What predictions were accurate, as well as the misses and misfires? We&rsquo;ll also explore what the West didn&rsquo;t understand at that time about the localisation of manga and anime, and compare it to the present.</p>

Craig
Welcome here to Edge Radio 99.3 FM with Craig as your host joined as always by Taylor. What&rsquo;s up Co host and this is now media mothership on media mothership. We explore how. Media and popular culture changes and shapes our world around us. In particular, I think the last week&rsquo;s episode, which we did on Cyberpunk had a fantastic thumbnail image for its YouTube and podcast, not really reacting with genuine. After an emotion so.
Speaker
Yeah.
Craig
That&rsquo;s all real, of course, because we are streaming on YouTube and Twitch. If you wanna see a video of us sitting here talking, you can jump onto the YouTube and Twitch. Let us know if the video audio is working. Last week we ran without audio.
Taylor
No.
Craig
And then we still got a couple of views. So I don&rsquo;t know what that says about our audio. But do let us know if the audio isn&rsquo;t. Working audio is. Certainly, but how will they?
Speaker
Use.
Craig
Know well because they can then go to the FM signal if they&rsquo;re within the Hobart metropolitan area.
Taylor
OK. Yeah. But if they&rsquo;ve already logged into this, then they&rsquo;re like Ohh Craig&rsquo;s just balled it up again.
Craig
Yeah. Then they log into youedgeradio.org dot AU. Wow.
Taylor
But they might not do.
Craig
Fine. Yes, they won&rsquo;t.
Speaker 4
Hear this, which is a shame.
Taylor
Exactly.
Speaker 4
But they would already.
Craig
Be fans of media mothership knowing. Then we also go. Off on the live stream on. Medium mothership sorry edgeradio.org dot yes.
Speaker
You.
Craig
We&rsquo;re also on the DAB. So feel free to audience interact with us on our SMS 0488811707 or post a comment on the Twitch or YouTube live stream, yeah. Let&rsquo;s hit the songs. That&rsquo;s beautiful. Thank you so much. Should I put both of your mics on? I wonder? You got kind of a stereotype happening there. Yeah. OK, good. Right. So today&rsquo;s topic. We are going back in time to 1995.
Taylor
No, just this one.
Craig
Oh yes, I came across.
Taylor
The year of my birth.
Craig
I. Ohh great what auspicious state? That was the year I completed my honours thesis. Looking at the irresponsible images of cyberpunk in Japanese animation, and I came across recently as I was cleaning up my. You know, huge archive of a library. One of the magazines I used to do my research with.
Speaker 4
Well that.
Craig
Was this one? Yeah, we&rsquo;ll hold that up to the camera. So this is comics and interviews 1995, issue 148. And this is at the cusp of anime kind of entering the western market, so I&rsquo;ve been. Kind of uploading my honest thesis to the media mothership website. Wow. So you know, people are gonna get so excited by this episode. They can go and read the honest thesis that that, you know, was part of the background research. But we&rsquo;re going to spend this article looking at the first article. We&rsquo;re going to spend this show looking. At the first article. In that magazine, which is speculating on the future, the current 1995 business structure of manga and anime in the US, and what the near future holds.
Taylor
As it says, what is anime and why is everybody talking about?
Craig
Yeah, so here it is.
Taylor
No, if you don&rsquo;t know what anime is, you probably call it a.
Craig
9 or something like that. Well, *** animation was the term. There was awkwardly used. Yeah, up until this point. So this is 30 years ago, so it&rsquo;s 2/20/25 now, so it&rsquo;s an opportune moment to look back 30 years ago as to what was this. Kind of, you know, quite quite significant cultural change, which was about to hit, I guess, just to put context, you know, put people in context. A quick snapshot of what 1995 was about, right. You&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re looking in terms of what the Internet meant in 1995. You you only had dial-up, so it was that classic modem sound sound. Google didn&rsquo;t exist.
Taylor
No, no.
Craig
Of course, you know it was very limited. It was, you know, you&rsquo;ve got universities have it. Some homes have it, but not everyone was at all engaged with the Internet. Well, you had really, there weren&rsquo;t any smartphones in 95, right, or at least not in my in my space, 95 was not a a kind of. I mean they were. They were smart furs, but they were really expensive.
Taylor
Really.
Craig
It wasn&rsquo;t. It wasn&rsquo;t a really smartphone era.
Taylor
No, I&rsquo;m talking flip phone.
Craig
Yeah, I mean, I do remember I got a phone, I got a phone, an old phone in like, 96. But it was super very expensive. Here&rsquo;s the one. Yeah. I mean, you had to pay for SMS calls. Yeah, right. It was incredibly expensive.
Taylor
Click on that smile. Yeah, he he is. For me. Oh no, that was that was when I was alive. You. Had to pay for SMS calls or or.
Craig
Alright, still into your age? Yeah.
Taylor
Or dollar per minute, sort of.
Craig
Thing. Yeah, I mean, I mean mainly you, you just use landline still there wasn&rsquo;t social media, social media was not a thing. And in terms of entertainment, we&rsquo;re looking at, you know particularly access to anime. It was either. Bootleg stuff. So you go to your local anime club at a university or some mates. House and you just watched bootleg VHS tapes that were on these mail order catalogues you could grab, and they&rsquo;re all fan subtitled. And it was super niche, right? The the kind of anime access was was very narrow. There was, you know, previous that Astro Boy battle for the planet Kimber. The white line that had been on television. Many people didn&rsquo;t really flock to those as being a distinctive Japanese experience. In fact, many people didn&rsquo;t know they came from Japan.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
So of course, today we have a very different landscape. You know, you&rsquo;ve got streaming, you&rsquo;ve got Crunchyroll streaming all the anime. You&rsquo;ve got cons which are set up specifically on anime cosplayers. So it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a radically different environment. You know, back then you were basically looking at TV schedules to figure out if SBS was going to show an anime movie.
Speaker
Hmm.
Craig
This wouldn&rsquo;t be 95. I mean SBS started to broadcast. And they, you know, I think probably late 90s anyway. So it was a much more niche space. It wasn&rsquo;t on demand and binge watching as it is today. So it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a radically radically different environment. Which is why the environment was kind of filled with images like this. We&rsquo;ll we&rsquo;ll play a short clip from Manga Entertainment. This was their cyberpunk, cyberpunk, cyberpunk cyberpunk collection promotion, right, tying into last week&rsquo;s discussion of Cyberpunk 2077.
Taylor
Flunk.
Craig
This is their pitch. This was 1995, so this is the turntable came out. This is the Cyberpunk collection promotion which gives you a taste of how anime was being marketed as a type of subversive, risky, futuristic experience that wasn&rsquo;t at all. The cartoons you&rsquo;re watching.
Taylor
At home, yeah.
Craig
All right.
Taylor
Nice.
Speaker 4
Yeah, any moment now.
Taylor
Do do, do, do do. Just talk amongst. Yourselves. Ohh, here we go. Here we go. Here we go. That we&rsquo;re still not going. You can&rsquo;t help digging.
Craig
Yeah. No, it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s yeah. Chest is loading up.
Speaker 5
As a team, sooner than you imagine. Presents you with the. A hyper reality experience that will reload your mind. 3 Series 9 episodes hard data, unlimited information, easy Access the Cyberpunk collection. Get. Ready for them? Cyber City Oedo 808 data one to three hard hitting criminals turn cops come up against some real mean cases in a bid to reduce their sentences. It can only mean action all the way to suicides. 80 police one to three, the police force of the future has its hands full, keeping crazy sideboards on control, especially when they look this cute. Don&rsquo;t.
Speaker 6
Watch it and squeamish.
Speaker
You can give me what Alice used to. Get me do that.
Speaker 5
Genocide in three mind-blowing hearts when a nutty professor plays with powers beyond his control, you can always be sure something&rsquo;s gonna happen. Well, it doesn&rsquo;t happen any weirder than this unbelievable entertainment. The Cyberpunk collection downloaded on video the future now.
Craig
Alright, so that&rsquo;s manga entertainments. Pitch for, you know, download the future on VHS.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
Now, so you know, it&rsquo;s throwing in this kind of assortment of future terms like download.
Taylor
Yeah, but.
Craig
Very much based in this kind of mid 90s non Internet based experience of you know you.
Speaker 4
Download it to your VHS, yeah.
Speaker
Which is.
Craig
So what I want to do now is with that in mind, right? So that&rsquo;s this idea of, you know mid 90s introducing manga and anime. Let&rsquo;s I&rsquo;ve I&rsquo;ve converted the article to audio using Clipchamp and an AI voice. So yeah, full acknowledgement that I. Just did it to me really.
Taylor
Did did you type it in or did you use sort of like AI vision to make the words?
Craig
Great. I scanned it and then I did OCR and I mean I could.
Taylor
OK. Scammed. Yeah.
Craig
Get you to read it, but. No, let&rsquo;s not. Yeah. So.
Taylor
I prefer to hear the.
Speaker 4
What?
Taylor
Voice of well hear.
Craig
How disastrous the AI is, and then we might change our mind. So here it is. So this is what we&rsquo;ll do is we&rsquo;ll go through like I do in my tutorials, paragraph by paragraph, breaking it down and analysing what it gets right, what it gets wrong about what it&rsquo;s foreseeing in the future. What shed some insight into? You. What media consumption was like back then and kind of, you know what, it underestimates all these?
Taylor
Questions. So who? Who&rsquo;s speaking?
Craig
Now this is so this article, it&rsquo;s weird. This article isn&rsquo;t attributed to an author right, but I was reading through it and I reckon this is a kind of promotion piece for one of the main US anime distributors at the time.
Taylor
Hmm.
Craig
They&rsquo;re called video comics coming out of. I think it&rsquo;s streamlined entertainment back then, most of the companies it&rsquo;s referring to have been brought up or become something else some.
Taylor
Yeah, I&rsquo;m. I I I meant the AI voice.
Craig
Of them, yeah. It&rsquo;s not Davis. It&rsquo;s not Davis. It&rsquo;s not Davis. They&rsquo;ve updated their AI voices so sadly not Davis, but yeah, this is an unattributed article via.
Taylor
Well, it says it says on the front. David Anthony Crafts Comics interview, so maybe it&rsquo;s David.
Craig
No, that&rsquo;s the editor of the magazine. And there is an editorial in that is an editorial in there but not there. Alright, let&rsquo;s start with paragraph 11 is anime and why is everybody talking about it from 1995 comics interviews issue 148.
Taylor
Then maybe he wrote. Too.
Speaker
All right. Do that.
Speaker 8
Why is everybody talking about it? Issue 140, eight, 1995? Over the past few years? Animation produced for the Japanese domestic. Market, known as anime, has been finding its way onto shelves in comic books, specialty retail shops, and video stores throughout the country. It is a business which has evolved out of an underground, unlicensed movement to bring this material into the states by the vanity duplication, red bootlegging of imported anime laser discs. The material which has surfaced. Has remained for the most part, niche product, which augments the imported manga Japanese comics. An occasional imported video game, which makes its way West. The potential for mainstream exposure to anime will be put to the test by several factors, including the syndicated television release of Sailor Moon and Dragon Ball, as well as upcoming video releases by mainstream distribution entities such as Sony Polygram and Orion Pictures. There are rumours that Marvel may even be considering. Entering into this field, Sony is launching its effort in.
Speaker 4
Alright, I will.
Craig
The and I&rsquo;ll pause it. There. So that&rsquo;s OK. So that&rsquo;s. This was first two paragraphs of I mean anything there that that rings a bell of familiarity to you. You were born on 95. So this isn&rsquo;t part of your lived experience. No. This was the world you were born into that it&rsquo;s prophesizing that, umm, you know we&rsquo;ve got Sailor Moon and Dragonball around the corner which is going to possibly be the. I mean this is the US market. So the strain market is slightly different, but I think you know certainly in terms of explaining the contemporary environment, it&rsquo;s much more globalised today. So we&rsquo;ve got Sailor Moon and Dragon Ball. We&rsquo;ve got companies like Sony, Polygram, Orion Pictures and Marvel. Anything leap off the page to you and say, Oh yes, I know.
Taylor
That well, the thing that immediately leaps off the page when it was read out to me was. Anime laser discs.
Craig
That is old fashion, isn&rsquo;t it? Laser disc have. You ever used watched laser?
Taylor
No, I don&rsquo;t know. What it is?
Craig
Ohh right lazy. This is a fantastic they came out kind of the next quantum leap up from VHS tapes. Yeah, it&rsquo;s meant to offer a more crisper digital image the size you could get them in will record sizes. So there were huge the size of an LP record.
Speaker
Hmm.
Taylor
Right. OK.
Craig
And you would normally need to get like 2 discs, 2 play an entire movie out. Of. They were quite clunky. They were prone to scratch and.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
They they only had a tiny market in Australia. I know when I went to when I was living in Sydney, I often go to the Chinatown video stores and they&rsquo;d have laser discs. You could get of Hong Kong Action Cinema. So I&rsquo;d often pick up a laser disc from them. And because I was in student accommodation with some Hong Kong students, they&rsquo;d have laser discs they&rsquo;d.
Speaker
Hmm.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
Brought home or brought back from Hong Kong, so it wasn&rsquo;t really an Australian market. But yeah, look, I mean this and also the US market, at least the discs. So it&rsquo;s not really a UK, Australian experience industry.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
Yeah. So that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s wonderfully dated. Yeah, the, the, the laser disc anime, laser disc space. The great thing about those laser discs were was that they they did get the you got the full art covers. So just like people love records for their arts because they&rsquo;re so large and the. The art can really pop seam with the laser discs, right compared to a a little crummy VHS box. The laser disc presentation was was was gorgeous, yeah, but super expensive.
Taylor
So this is Marvel is that that&rsquo;s not what&rsquo;s it called Marvel, that&rsquo;s not US.
Craig
That was that was you just Marvel. There was Marvel Comics, right? So this is, you know, I mean, Marvel went through a number of hiccups but was still considered one of the big media players in terms of, you know, certainly. I mean it was, it was this with DC superhero comic producer.
Taylor
Novels. OK.
Craig
Marvel hadn&rsquo;t done much in terms of animation. A couple of projects, but it wasn&rsquo;t successful. But nevertheless, yeah. It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s Marvel&rsquo;s interest in manga was seen as one of these moments of wow, a big US comic book publisher is considering entering the comic book space. Yeah, none of that of course happened. I mean, it&rsquo;s a bit right and wrong. I mean, Sailor Moon, you&rsquo;re familiar with Sailor Moon? Did you ever experience anything to do with?
Taylor
Never, never watched any of it, but of it. And I&rsquo;ve seen pictures.
Craig
Of it, right? So it completely missed.
Taylor
You yeah.
Craig
Yeah, I mean it. Was on Australian TV for a bit. And you know in 95 it launched in Canada as a syndicated cartoon show and then to the US at the end of 95 and it made it its way to the UK and Australia and was part of the the kind of morning, the school morning and afternoon cartoon blocks.
Speaker
Hmm.
Taylor
I mean, it might have been when I was, like, conscious, but yeah, pretty pretty much my thing was between 2004 and 2012 is what I remember since for being.
Craig
Look it. Yeah, yeah. And look, Salamine didn&rsquo;t become.
Taylor
A child.
Craig
The big success? That was prophesised in terms of it was successful, but it wasn&rsquo;t a huge cultural phenomena that again, you know they they point to Dragon Ball as the next.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
Possible cab off the rank that&rsquo;s going to create a huge swell and mainstream manga and enemy interest that is a little stronger. Dragon Ball Z gained quite a larger following and again launched in 95. It did struggle initially with low ratings.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
But has still ticked over what&rsquo;s considered a mediocre success. Yes, it&rsquo;s interesting as I&rsquo;m reading through this article that the the big success isn&rsquo;t mentioned. Which is Pokemon. Oh, yeah, yeah, right. So Pokemon didn&rsquo;t come on the scene until 98 in terms of its animation run, and you can really see there what? What? What? It took to become successful, right? That yes, while Dragon Ball and salmon are are mainstream successful properties, they weren&rsquo;t at the level of Pok&eacute;mon and it&rsquo;s kind of huge machine of success across video games. Plushies, cartoons and you know, the fact that pretty much everyone&rsquo;s heard of Pok&eacute;mon.
Taylor
Hmm.
Craig
You know, in a way beyond, you know, I&rsquo;ve seen an image. Of Sailor Moon. Yeah. Experience. So the real success that they&rsquo;re hoping for doesn&rsquo;t come until at least after 98, you know, in the US you have those kind of syndicated or those kind of compilation cartoon shows for kids called. Tsunami, which was much like cartoon connection or Agro&rsquo;s cartoon show or.
Taylor
All of these, which I&rsquo;ve never.
Craig
Within. Yeah, I mean it&rsquo;s state by state, right, in Australia, I&rsquo;m not sure what test he had in terms of like some shows after you come home from school, there&rsquo;d be a host that would introduce cartoons.
Taylor
Heard of? Yeah. Watch roller coaster.
Speaker 4
That you&rsquo;d.
Craig
OK, roller coaster here, except it&rsquo;s that you know I had. Yeah. Ohh, yeah. TV, right. Yeah. So those would. Those are the moments in the strain market, those curated experiences, that would then hype and introduce animation.
Taylor
Chase TV.
Craig
Those which made that successful change, but that wasn&rsquo;t, yeah, that wasn&rsquo;t this 95 period, nor the initial years after 95. It really didn&rsquo;t reach into that success. And certainly in terms of Sailor Moon and Dragonball Z, you know both. Both were were middling successes. They&rsquo;re fondly remembered, but it wasn&rsquo;t in terms of how the articles kind of setting up the the the big hope for success.
Taylor
They&rsquo;re still relatively well known.
Craig
Yeah, yeah, yeah. So a small I mean a small clip in terms of you know, so this is what this is a short another short example from another Saturday anime promo from 95. This is from the US channel. I think it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s the Sci fi channel in 1995, so this gives you an example of what the promotion was for anime in 1995 in America for their site site.
Taylor
On the Sci Fi channel, yeah.
Speaker 6
This fall, Saturday mornings on the Sci Fi channel, it&rsquo;s Japanese animation in the raw and this ain&rsquo;t no swim in the. People being urge anime that&rsquo;s pure power and sheer genius. Saturday anime on the Sci Fi Channel coming this fall.
Speaker 7
See ready to receive this sacrifice?
Craig
So it&rsquo;s a little more salacious. Yeah, you know, it&rsquo;s.
Speaker
Hey.
Craig
Very much that kind of coming in.
Taylor
Animated television doesn&rsquo;t have to be for kids anymore.
Speaker
Yeah.
Speaker 4
That&rsquo;s it, yeah.
Craig
Yeah. And I guess that&rsquo;s the market they&rsquo;re trying to open up. Yeah, it&rsquo;s not just the children&rsquo;s experience anymore. It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s adult and risky. Anyway, jumping back to.
Speaker
The article? Yep.
Speaker 8
Animated version of Street Fighter Two offered at an extreme selfie price point, Polygram has taken on the distribution of the US branch of a UK company, manga Entertainment and Orion. Home video has entered the picture by making an output deal with streamlined pictures to serve as the distribution arm of streamlined video comics library. Each of these distribution companies has a different approach in attempting to bring this material to the mass.
Speaker 4
Sorry.
Speaker 8
Market Sony and Polygram are handling the video distribution as a traditional music company distributor. Orion, on the other hand, has concentrated on distributing streamlined video comics as a traditional video distributor.
Craig
There. So it&rsquo;s interesting. The reference to manga and attainment so. Manga. I mean the the Australian experience of manga and anime was really heavily defined through the success the US. Manga anime import companies had, like in particular, Manga Entertainment, and they took a much more direct to video market. You could pick those up at your video store and so forth, whereas in the US, yeah, they&rsquo;re setting up this idea of. You know, later on we&rsquo;ll talk about trying to do a they&rsquo;ll do a these are release first. They&rsquo;ll bring it to an arts cinema. Mm-hmm. And then they&rsquo;ll get mail, order, catalogue sales going so not as successful as my entertainments began became Sony. You know what they&rsquo;re talking about, you know, Sony Polygram.
Speaker 7
Yeah.
Craig
The. And and video comic, Sony is really the only one today.
Taylor
That, yeah, it&rsquo;s still around.
Craig
That&rsquo;s, you know, yeah, that that&rsquo;s the long term winner of the, you know, setting up the manga anime experience that they&rsquo;ve got and not at all the way I mean here they&rsquo;re characterising Sony as you know a traditional music company distributor whereas yeah the Sony.
Speaker
Hmm.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
They you know where they their own Spiderman and it owns, you know it. It sets up its own animation division. So it&rsquo;s a much larger.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
Content creator today than it was in 95 and very much this kind of the 95 Sony they&rsquo;re talking about. Isn&rsquo;t what?
Taylor
It became. I can&rsquo;t believe you just called Sony a content creator.
Craig
Yeah, there. Yeah, Sony, Sony did some anime content creation content creator. Yeah. Like, like, Mr Beast. Yeah. Yeah. Sonny&rsquo;s content creator. Mr Beast, content creator. Yeah. So the. This. Yeah, the Orion home videos set up with streamlined pictures trying to grow that American popular culture anime space. But it was very short lived. I mean, I mean, there was a boom here in 95. UM, but yeah, the the irony being that. The prediction that they&rsquo;re making here is right and wrong. Orion&rsquo;s traditional video distribution approach. Did work quite well initially, but then it was Sonny&rsquo;s pivot to actually making that content rather than just distributing it. That that made the huge difference. Let&rsquo;s see how.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
The article goes on to explain Orion and some of the products that Orion was working.
Speaker 8
On Ryan, approach seems to work given the context of streamlined library. Since its inception seven years ago. Streamline Pictures has concentrated on acquiring. The best theatrical anime available for distribution in North America streamlines initial exploitation of these films begins with theatrical exhibition in independent theatres and through theatrical repertory. Once an animated film has received some critical reception and played through a number of major city.
Taylor
I mean fantastic.
Speaker 8
It is made available for home video, streamlined string of theatrical releases include Akira, Fist of the North Star, the professional Vampire Hunter Dee Robot, Carnival Lensman, Wicked City, and the forthcoming space adventure Cobra.
Craig
So North star, the. The professional vampire hunter D Akira robot Carnival Linsman wicked city space adventure cobra. You know, these were really the big titles that got global interest in the West from Japan.
Taylor
And have now become unknown.
Craig
I guess yeah, the the very nostalgically remembered Akira, Fist of the North Star.
Taylor
Spiderman Batman lend man with the magnifying glass.
Craig
You know, you say they they are pretty dated. Well, I guess. OK, I&rsquo;ll play a clip. So here&rsquo;s some promotion. Here&rsquo;s some promotions for those. Particular title, so this is the Akira Sci Fi channel promotion. We&rsquo;ll have a little listen to that just to put us in the mood as to how they&rsquo;re promoting it. It was it was a good strategy they had in terms of first. Releasing them on cinema in the cinema and in our kind of art house cinemas. So Akira 98. Sorry in 1988 was distributed Tantric ally in the US. Many of these other titles came to Australia in anime kind of movie festivals that would play at, you know, village or Hoyts for a short period of time. Yeah, they were.
Speaker 6
Yeah.
Taylor
Other cinemas also available.
Craig
Well, I mean that was the thing about these strange cinema market. There were small boutique cinemas, but you were pretty much talking about cause. I know I went to see the anime festival. The manga, manga, manga. Festival that had fist of the North Star Gogo 13 robot Carnival space adventure cobra and that was that was that. That was at Hoyts, right? Yeah. You were still stuck going to your your big cinema. And that was the Australian market, the. The smaller cinema chains were, yeah, but weren&rsquo;t located as centrally. Anyway, here&rsquo;s the Akira promo from 98.
Speaker 7
Warning the following offer is for mature audiences only. Exciting, mysterious, intense, graphic, provocative, raw. This is no ordinary animation. This is the exotic, bizarre and beautiful world of Japanese anime and this is your invitation to enter with a modern. Classic Akira. Critics say Akira makes Blade Runner look like Disney World. It&rsquo;s action packed, the future of animation. Siskel and Ebert call it the video pick of the week. Akira is yours for only four. 35 with subscription when you order the best of Japanese animation collection series with these state of the art sci-fi classics, you will enter a world beyond imagination. A future out of control and an experience you will never forget. Don&rsquo;t say we didn&rsquo;t warn you. Call 1-800-414-4422 now. To order Akira for only 495 plus.
Craig
3495.
Speaker 7
79.
Taylor
Yeah.
Speaker 6
Volumes are 19.
Speaker 4
That&rsquo;s the cheap. Anyway, that phone number probably doesn&rsquo;t work anymore. You could ask for your phone 95 copy of it here. But yeah it.
Craig
Was it was a really interesting strategy in terms of this idea of prestige anime they were offering with titles like Akira. It was going to be this kind of approaching 21st century anime portal that you could watch at the cinema and then you&rsquo;d order it via mail. The catalogue? Yeah, to get it. And that was the US model where it wasn&rsquo;t the Australian and UK model was different. It was really manga. Entertainment did a fantastic job of getting into all the video stores, getting their product pushed out, you know, five titles for 10 bucks or how much it was. Whereas yes, the US markets here was theatrical release then order it online, you know, and the VHS&rsquo;s were were, I don&rsquo;t know VHS&rsquo;s were really expensive to produce and distribute. So 495 and 98, you must have been stuck in a kind of like this is your first one.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
And then you&rsquo;ve gotta get 10 other titles at $40 each or something.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
Uh, also, what&rsquo;s interesting here is that this strategy. Of course exists without without a kind of Internet fan community that we have today, where they&rsquo;d be bingeing or where you just get through the whole episode you were waiting for whenever this movie was gonna get scheduled, then you&rsquo;d watch the video. There&rsquo;d be a trailer like that at the start. So it was, I guess, what this is emphasising is it&rsquo;s niche.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a small amount of product. You have to timetable yourself to get to the movie, to watch it, then you have to. Order it umm, wait for it to come in the mail or go to the video store and whatever titles they&rsquo;ve stocked is what you&rsquo;re going to to watch and I guess you&rsquo;ve got, you know, word of mouth that this is trying to build. So let&rsquo;s go to the next paragraph.
Speaker 8
Has been the company&rsquo;s focus on distributing English language versions of these films. The bulk of the material released in the US has been put out in subtitled versions, streamlines President Karl Massack, an animation producer in his own right, has noted that all animation is dubbed, and that streamlines goal is to make viewer friendly product, which will be. Easy to assimilate by the mainstream public. The longevity of these titles as classic anime and the quality of the original and English language post production have positioned streamlines Video comics titles as an Evergreen Library, which sells significant numbers for every title month after month. A recent article in Newsweek still points to Akira as the major title in this niche genre.
Craig
All animation is dubbed which is which is a little inside to one of the big debates that raged back then in 95 and still today, which is the sub versus dub debates, right, which this article is staking its claim with. Carl Macek&rsquo;s claim that.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
You know or point that all the animation is dubbed to legitimise the English dubbing of anime. That was pretty much the standard during this 95 period. Most of the titles.
Speaker
Hmm.
Craig
You were going to be watching dubbed, and there was some backlash amongst some fans at that point saying they&rsquo;d prefer it subbed. Yeah. But that was considered a a premium product that you had to pay more for to get the subtitled version. And you know, there weren&rsquo;t as many titles available. Most of the titles were going to be dubbed. And the idea being what there was that, you know, it needed to be, as the article saying viewer friendly product which is easy to assume. Relate by the mainstream public, and their idea was that the only way that could happen would be is is dubbing it into English. What do you have any feelings about the dub versus sub debate? Do you reckon they were right there that actually you know it it it did require it to get dumped that it was when it was dubbed in English that it was.
Speaker
But.
Taylor
All I can talk about is is, from what I&rsquo;ve seen, I prefer dark. Pok&eacute;mon, Pok&eacute;mon. Yeah. Spirited away all of Studio Ghibli.
Craig
Any reason why? Why do you prefer dumb?
Taylor
I don&rsquo;t know. It just sounds better to my ears, yeah.
Speaker 8
Oh, it does.
Craig
I mean there there&rsquo;s a whole series. If you&rsquo;re bored looking for something to do. Do a YouTube search of Subverse dub. There all these compilations of which performance does it better?
Speaker 9
Yeah.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
I mean the initial 95 period is notorious for having poorly paid. Unprofessional. Yeah, you know, non voice actor people doing the dub.
Taylor
Yeah.
Speaker
Hmm.
Taylor
Have you ever you&rsquo;ve seen squid game? Yes. Have you listened to the dubbed versions Squid game? It is.
Craig
Oh, heaven, yeah, I can&rsquo;t. Well, I it&rsquo;s not. I can&rsquo;t. I could, but.
Taylor
It is. It is really terrible.
Craig
Makes it so bad.
Taylor
Because they the the the voice actors for I had no idea. They don&rsquo;t put any emphasis or any. Like change to their voice and they said Ohh that person has died. Now let me go over here.
Craig
And yeah, look and and you know, in some ways that&rsquo;s where this philosophy could be considered as as short sighted in terms of in today&rsquo;s streaming environment where you can choose double sub at the flick of a switch. It does give you this experience of listening to the actor themselves perform possibly a more authentic experience than the unemotional dub that it.
Taylor
Sounds like whereas if you have Howl&rsquo;s moving castle, yeah, Hal played by Christian Bale in his best performance.
Craig
Really. OK. Yeah, yeah. Because I know well, I think Ponyo has Liam Nielsen in it. There was a moment where Jubilee. I mean, see, that&rsquo;s the other thing. That this article, this. Jubilee was after this article as well, so this is the other. I mean, I point to two things that happened after this article, which really did make anime huge.
Taylor
Yes. Yeah.
Speaker
Hmm.
Craig
And neither of which are in this article because. It would be a problem. One is Pok&eacute;mon and the second one is Jubilee, right that that Jubilee was. I mean, this article was talking a lot about aspiring to mainstream success that were looking for his titles and dubbing it so we can get it into family-friendly product that can be easily assimilated to the mainstream public. That arrived with. With Jubilee, yeah, right. And and anything up until Jubilee was a partial success. Right, Sailor Moon. Right. All these efforts to launch. I mean, none of the titles. So. Far that we&rsquo;ve looked at. You know, Akira, Fist of the North Star Gogo 13, the professional vampire hunter. Do you? Robot Carnival lensman, wicked city space adventurer are family friendly, right? They&rsquo;re all very much your niche Sci Fi action adventure violence, you know. Whereas yes, it wasn&rsquo;t until jubbly.
Taylor
Yeah. Violent.
Craig
I feel like you know my neighbour Totoro spirit was spirited away was the film that synchronised both? I think the same time it launched in Japan, it launched in the West and was considered to be enormously globally successful.
Taylor
Yeah.
Speaker
For.
Craig
And then the the dubbing for it. Also you&rsquo;d have famous Western actors starting to dub jiggly films in particular. So yeah, yeah. And that, that, that that&rsquo;s not until quite a few years after this this article. But it is I mean the one thing.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
They get right is the. Is that kind of prestige anime, which is what Jubilee also offered? Yeah, that Jubilee offered that prestige product. Which is family friendly, that once it&rsquo;s dubbed, it&rsquo;s it doesn&rsquo;t lose its japaneseness, which I think is where this article gets it wrong as well. I think they define, you know, viewer friendly product that is easy to assimilate by the mainstream public. Also you know not to Japanese, right? Yes, it can be cyberpunk future.
Taylor
Hmm.
Craig
It can be, you know, assassin James Bond type character and Gogo 13 BS. Not that and and I guess the other title here that I mean 95 Evangelion screens in Japan, it&rsquo;s not until a few years later that it screens in Australia in the West. So Evangelion also probably is that the title it&rsquo;s still a bit niche though, isn&rsquo;t it? Evangelion not really.
Taylor
I&rsquo;ve not heard of him.
Craig
You have really. Yeah. You and Gina Cecil. Evangelion. Ohh yeah. Well, see, that&rsquo;s interesting. So that was a real cultural touchstone. Anime. It was on TV. People fell in love with it. But maybe a bit like attack on Titan, right? If.
Speaker 4
You.
Taylor
I&rsquo;ve I&rsquo;ve heard.
Speaker 10
Yeah.
Craig
Of one piece right. You have to be of that generation. To to to say ohh that that broke through to the mainstream. Yeah. Yeah. OK. Yeah. OK. That&rsquo;s interesting. Yeah. So in that case, that&rsquo;s not the third factor. It&rsquo;s still Pok&eacute;mon and Ghibli films. Yeah, that are really the two central properties. Alright. Well, let&rsquo;s push on. Let&rsquo;s push on.
Speaker 8
Recent activity in the acquisition of Anime Properties by a growing number of US distributors has given streamline and Orion cores to reevaluate their marketing strategy. But rather than compete with the glut of product, it&rsquo;s flooding the.
Craig
Market I don&rsquo;t.
Speaker 8
Know what that streamline is? Content to work on quality productions. It&rsquo;s like the tortoise.
Speaker 4
Decibel.
Speaker 8
In the hay, every new company is trying to beat the competitor to the punch with the latest material from Japan. We had a goal in mind when we started. We made a list of titles and went after that list. So far we have been able to acquire distribution rights to nearly every title we set out to bring to market. The strategy seems to be working. This new product, produced for the domestic Japanese market, is getting farther and farther away from the neutral international productions of the late 1980s. Following the phenomenal success of highly ethnocentric teen adventure series Sailor Moon, $250 million at last count. Most new anime productions incorporate the same sort of super deformed characters and physical gestures, which contributed to the programmes uncanny popularity. But as these gestures and design elements become more and more esoteric and obtuse, the ability of this type of material to take hold in the savvy mainstream US domestic merchandising arena is uncertain.
Craig
Of course, there&rsquo;s a number of really interesting points. Yeah, but first. You know, so I&rsquo;ll play a little clip from the Gogo 13 assassin thing for us to listen to. Just quickly now.
Speaker 4
Yeah.
Speaker 9
Leonard Dawson is the richest man in the world. Powerful people make enemies. If an enemy becomes a problem, someone calls the professional code name.
Speaker 10
Gogo, 13 Target former Nazi S captain Bernard Mueller.
Speaker 9
I&rsquo;ll take the job. He never kills for sport, he never misses the mark. And he never gets involved.
Speaker 6
Can&rsquo;t you let this one go?
Speaker 10
There&rsquo;s.
Speaker 9
But this time it&rsquo;s personal. The hunter has become the hunted because this time he&rsquo;s the target.
Speaker 10
We found Gogo Thirteens preparing to shoot Sir.
Speaker 6
Go see if you got him this time.
Speaker 10
We had him cornered, he was wounded, and yet he was never captured and the sanction the next.
Speaker 5
Time either he died or you died.
Speaker 9
I want to know who&rsquo;s really behind all this. Did you find out who ordered it?
Speaker 10
I will not tolerate it a third time. Do you understand me? That the next time you fail, it&rsquo;s what you are. We have only one enemy. The call goes 13.
Speaker 6
Cheers.
Craig
Yeah. So that&rsquo;s typical kind of adult, aimed not to your gibly or Pok&eacute;mon space, but where I think this the article talks about how. You know, will these really culturally specific? It refers to them as esoteric and obtuse gestures. So in particular it points to super deformed characters and physical gestures. In the sense of Sailor Moon, it&rsquo;s saying it it it made to the programmes uncanny popularity. It&rsquo;s very much dismissing the japaneseness of it. So my reading of this is that, you know, when it refers to highly ethnocentric teen adventure Sailor Moon and then it says, you know. The sort of super deformed characters it has, and physical gestures, it&rsquo;s saying.
Taylor
Hmm.
Craig
You know those? Those are really 2 Japanese and the questions it&rsquo;s asking here is will this material take hold in the savvy mainstream US domestic merchandise area, right. So will people want to buy your car, IE cute, you know? The deformed you know the Super deformed phrases. It&rsquo;s shibby. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Super deformed was the phrase for it 95.
Taylor
Looks.
Craig
It literally translated the kind of chibi or kawaii. Character distortion. So you&rsquo;d have a character like Sailor Moon or Dragon Ball, who maybe is portrayed a little more action oriented, but then you&rsquo;d have the Super cute version of.
Taylor
It, yeah.
Craig
Which would be kind of a squashed version. You know the eyes would be bigger.
Taylor
Yeah, less and less detail, yeah.
Craig
Do you think that aesthetic? Has in fact become. Popular do you think that the chippy? Super deformed. Anime Style is is a popular style.
Taylor
More than what? More than what they expected.
Craig
Yeah, yeah, I would agree. I would agree. My feeling here is again this is an example of the article saying, you know, that stuff&rsquo;s too Japanese and what they&rsquo;re looking for is more culturally neutral properties. That their argument being the 95 and future western market will only be successful if it&rsquo;s not too weird and other. Which I think gets it wrong. I mean, particularly if you look at Dibella&rsquo;s success, where it is culturally specific in many of their shows, certainly my neighbour Totoro, Kiki&rsquo;s well, maybe less so Kiki&rsquo;s delivery service. But there are aspects of the aesthetics of it there will be, you know, Carla E cute characters that are are kind of. Will trade there. Any do you? What would you say would be the most? Cute or? Jubilee film, right? The one which had a lot of. Merchandise or todero the Totoro creature.
Taylor
I reckon, yeah. And then all of the little other little goblin, not just the big one, but all of the small ones, which were like a lot smaller, and then they could have the life size.
Craig
Yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I think that. Became quite a popular design. For that. So yeah, I&rsquo;d say that.
Taylor
Nausica with those beasts.
Craig
Different I think those are good. Yeah. I mean, there are cute versions because no secure is a kind of Mad Max post apocalyptic wasteland space.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
Yeah, alright, well, well, we&rsquo;ve got about 5 minutes left on the show, so we&rsquo;ll push through to the end of the article.
Taylor
Ohh good.
Speaker 8
As far as Massa can streamline are concerned is in Co production and joint ventures with anime producers and rights holders. By combining the best of both East and West and new category of product will be unleashed for global consumption. Several other companies have the similar viewpoints. Manga, Entertainment, Bandai and several other companies are pre buying territories. The new anime productions Jim Lee&rsquo;s GN 13 is scheduled to hit the market sometime in 1996 as a direct to video production.
Craig
This is really interesting. So Gen 13, have you ever heard this title? So Gen 13, so they they talk a lot about Gen 13 in their SCI article saying yeah, this is the article, this is the anime. So speech to comic book series Gen 13, it&rsquo;s kind of an X man comic from Jim Lee. It&rsquo;s not part of Marvel or DC.
Taylor
No, never.
Craig
UM. In 95 they were producing it to for it to become this big adult animation from Disney that was going to be this kind of, you know, enemies creating Akira and Ghost in the Shell. Well, the West can do this with Gen 13, so there was a lot of hype on Gen 13 ended up. Not being distributed, they held it. It never had a US release. It got released in the UK and Australia on a limited release and was forgotten about. It was just dumped. It&rsquo;s fascinating looking at the Wikipedia entry for Gen 13, I mean successful comic book series.
Taylor
All right.
Craig
And they they kind of screened it at A at the Wizard World Chicago Convention in 98, and it was pulled, it never got a America release, at least according to Wikipedia. And it was considered not to have the type of Polish that people thought a Disney. Film should have.
Taylor
Right. OK. Yeah.
Craig
And it was. It was a gamble. It was, yeah, a more adult oriented kind of teen mature. It&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s the.
Speaker
Time. No.
Craig
Reminding me I&rsquo;m wrapping up. My shirt. OK, that&rsquo;s good. But it is interesting that kind of, you know, East West collaboration that they also have in this article didn&rsquo;t really pan out. You had some titles like Afro Samurai and later years, quite a few years after this, but that, that model they&rsquo;re speaking about here that the future they see in the anime business is for collaboration. Between East and West, that&rsquo;s the only way you&rsquo;ll get a huge Western English speaking market. And spin off benefits to Japan ended up being completely wrong. Yeah, right. Japan dominated after 95 with anime titles it was producing Jubilee being probably the best example of that, but many, many other Japanese based companies went on to enormous success.
Taylor
Here.
Craig
Yu-gi-oh one piece right? I mean, everything was from Japanese companies. Still, right? It wasn&rsquo;t Co produced with Marvel or Co produced with DC Comics, right? It was Japanese produced for maybe an initial domestic market that then had a a global.
Taylor
Yeah.
Speaker
Hmm.
Craig
Spin off and maybe there was a western version of it. You do the live action one piece now, 30 years later with one piece, right? But but not at all. Not at all the type of.
Speaker
But.
Craig
Success that this article prophesized well, let&rsquo;s let&rsquo;s a musical interlude, and we&rsquo;ll come back with final thoughts.
Speaker
Yeah.
Craig
Yeah. So welcome back to me, you mothership. There we go predictions. What nailed it? I mean, not much. Sailor Moon. Dragon Ball weren&rsquo;t the big properties that it was saying the future of anime is going to be defined by that ended up being a few years later with.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
Pok&eacute;mon. And and there were more misses and misfires. I think with the whole idea of the less Japanese, the product is the better you know. Again I think Jubilee. Spoke to the opposite of that. Yeah, the fact that Japan went on to have an enormous tourist boom linked to this idea of its soft power with manga and anime. You had artists like Quentin Tarantino wanting to bring in a bit of Japanese vibe with a short animated Japanese anime feature in kill Bill, right?
Taylor
Hmm.
Craig
Just having any Japanese anime vibe in there because of its cultural difference became became central. Yeah. And I think in terms of this article, you can see a lot of failure to understand the Japanese market at this point. And what was making their animation. Superior to at least a western market for an older demographic.
Taylor
And what the Western tastes would be.
Craig
As well as. Yeah, yeah. You know, I think, you know, I think Salem&rsquo;s going on to become an interesting character. But yeah, at the time it was first launched in 95, failed to get the type of success. They were hoping for.
Speaker
Hmm.
Craig
Or. So I think these days with like streaming services like crunchy roll and being able to jump between a double or a sub shows that whole kind of all animation is dubbed and therefore you know we just want to localise it into what is Western the most western of it. It shows shows it&rsquo;s different so. You know, we&rsquo;ll consider now what will be popular in. The next 30 years, yeah.
Taylor
I just reminded of my favourite dub from Pok&eacute;mon, which is I&rsquo;ll turn my trusty frying pan into a drying pan and that is a a gag which would not work in the.
Craig
I yes. Original. Yeah. Well, I I did have an honest student, Susan Cunnings shout out to Susan, fan of the show. She did her honest thesis on the.
Taylor
Oh yeah.
Craig
Western dub of Pok&eacute;mon yeah, and all the things they relabeled like Onigiri was relabeled as a doughnut. Even even though it was drawn still as as a rice ball.
Taylor
OK. Yeah.
Craig
Yeah, yeah, she she collected all these examples of just tone deaf localization efforts to remove this kind of like, you know, well, you know, we&rsquo;ll it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a cartoon or it&rsquo;s a comic. So no one will notice.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
Anyway, so let&rsquo;s let&rsquo;s media mothership for another week. Show notes are available via the podcast. Join us on discord. We&rsquo;re setting that up now. So yeah, keep listening. We&rsquo;ve got a special broadcast of arianna&rsquo;s bookshelf. Yeah, coming up that we&rsquo;ll have an interview with. With a fantastic author, so keep listening now to Edge radio.
Taylor
An unnamed.
Craig
Fantastic author. Well, I thought you had a, didn&rsquo;t you have a post saying something or the? OK, you just wanted to remind me that make sure or by 5.
Taylor
No, no. Yeah.
Craig
OK, keep listening to Edge Radio 99.3 FM.

Craig
Yes, we&rsquo;re fun. Double the fun. That&rsquo;s a lot of media mothership happening today.
Taylor
Example. Wow.
Craig
And again again, third times a charm. Third time is a charm.
Taylor
Third time.
Craig
Alright, so you&rsquo;re listening to me. Your membership here on Edge Radio. 99.3 FM. As always, we look at everything in and around the world of media and how it shapes our understanding of the world around. Us. I&rsquo;m your host, Craig, joined by Taylor.
Taylor
Hey.
Craig
And on music today, roonan.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
Let&rsquo;s hear a musical interlude. Very cool thumb piano. Kalimba. Yeah. Playing there tunes to help us get us into today&rsquo;s topic, which is cyberpunk? Techno Orientalism, representation of Asia and the video game in particular, cyberpunk. 2077, which both Taylor and I have been playing. Yes, finally passed the. Your first act. Yeah, in my game play through, so still new, but really struck by how fascinating.
Taylor
So that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re playing.
Craig
It is, it is indeed. Yes, yes, so. We&rsquo;re going to be chatting a little bit about the generalities of Cyberpunk 2077 as well as most importantly, what I find the most fascinating aspect of it. Which is the. Representation of Asia that&rsquo;s in this game.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
So all that and more coming up soon on media mothership, we&rsquo;ll go to a short musical interlude. OK, welcome back, medium mothership. So Cyberpunk 2077 is an action RPG video game developed by CD Project React Red.
Taylor
I think it&rsquo;s.
Craig
Some would say they did wreck their launch and it&rsquo;s based on our. Talsorian ANS games cyberpunk tabletop RPG. Yep, which goes right back to I think the 90s or 80s that that tabletop RPG came out anyway, so the title of. CD Projekt Reds. Cyberpunk 2077 is is that this is the first game. We&rsquo;ve moved on to since The Witcher. Yep, so they did the witches game series, which was enormously successful and. This is quite a gear shift for them as opposed to the fantasy world of Witcher. This is as the Games title suggests, set in a cyberpunk future. Very dystopian as all cyberpunk fiction is where ultra modern technology is coexisting.
Taylor
Well.
Craig
Alongside of, you know, a human society that is suffering all manner of calamity, the location of the game is night city. Which is a Free State of California within the world building. The year, as the name of the title suggests, is 2077, so it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s our future as well. But if you&rsquo;ve played the tabletop game, you&rsquo;d know that basically this is an alternate future that started way back in the 90s. I think it started to diverge. Where? Yeah.
Taylor
But even even within the game itself, they say.
Craig
You see, Michael because.
Taylor
Even within the game itself, they talk about how certain events in the game happened in 2020, so it&rsquo;s definitely an alternate.
Speaker
Yes.
Craig
That&rsquo;s right. Yeah. So there&rsquo;s some flashbacks where a, you know, a a big tower complex is destroyed, and even that is within a far advanced technological version of our world. But it&rsquo;s not a kind of utopic technology. Future. This world is very much. As happens in all Saver Punk, we&rsquo;re looking at mega corporations, multinational corporations Akasaka in this game and militech. So it&rsquo;s the names kind of of arasaka is, as a Japanese based company within that of course the idea that.
Taylor
Mm-hmm. Had a. Sucker.
Craig
As is standard for 80s cyberpunk world building, Japan and Asia is a rising power, and in many ways eclipsing the US and the Wests Power. In this game, you do have militech as the US based.
Speaker
Hmm.
Taylor
Military technology.
Craig
Technology company. Yep. And so basically, these two organisations are pretty much managing most aspects of life. There are still functioning governments, but the real power and technology and yeah, the the political power, the technology. Your power is all based within companies.
Taylor
Yeah. And everything&rsquo;s in vending machines.
Craig
That&rsquo;s right, there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s a. Lot of have you seen? I mean you&rsquo;ve not played Cyberpunk 2077. Have you seen it online in any fashion?
Speaker 4
Yes.
Taylor
Yes, I&rsquo;ve watched the play few of.
Craig
It OK what are? Some of the things you recall from the play through Ronan.
Taylor
Ohh it&rsquo;s very depressing in some parts.
Craig
In terms of the aesthetics of the world.
Taylor
In terms of the aesthetics and the. Yeah, wealth divide.
Craig
Exactly. Yeah, there&rsquo;s quite a stark rich versus poor class divide within the game space and in many ways. You know you. Could say that in this global world, the the rich and the poor, the the only united global experiences. More so than national identities. So in the game you&rsquo;re playing a kind of St level character. You can kind of, I guess, choose from various type of of of builds for your character, like a kind of tech based build or.
Taylor
A cybernetic build.
Craig
Right to kind of tag. And it&rsquo;s a very adult game as well. There&rsquo;s sex and violent crime as well as as Ronan&rsquo;s pointing out, extreme poverty. It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s very confronting collapse of the American dream. So even though you&rsquo;re in America, there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s quite. A lot of. Of Asia, that&rsquo;s there. You&rsquo;re playing as the character V. UM, and you know, I guess you start the game trying to break into the big time, right? You&rsquo;re trying to to kind of climb out of a kind of nobody existence.
Taylor
Yeah. Well, you&rsquo;re, you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re being a Merson. Is really it?
Craig
So you&rsquo;re getting. A lot of missions you&rsquo;re going on. 1. As you&rsquo;re trying to, you know, become famous or improve your status within this cyberpunk space. Interestingly, kind of joining you on the mission is a character called Johnny Silverhand. Whose voice, likeness and motion capture were provided by Keanu Reeves.
Speaker 4
Yep.
Taylor
Your birth taking.
Craig
That&rsquo;s right. That was his fantastic experience at the sober Punk 2077 launch, where he came out on stage. and You know someone suddenly from the. Audience, what did they say?
Taylor
You&rsquo;re breathtaking.
Craig
And Keanu Reeves, without missing a beat, Jess turns around and says.
Speaker
You&rsquo;re.
Craig
So let&rsquo;s listen to that little clip now.
Speaker 5
OK, but let me tell you. The feeling of of being there, of walking the streets of the future is really going to be breathtaking. Your breath taping. You&rsquo;re all breathtaking.
Craig
So I mean, and that clips kind of.
Speaker 5
All right, all right.
Craig
Indicative of the real goodwill. That this game had leading up to its launch right? The sense that not only was this from an excellent top notch game company.
Taylor
Hmm.
Craig
That had shown itself as highly supportive of its fan base, providing a lot of free DLCS which were enormous. But also, as that launch suggests, you know, they have no expense has been spared. It seems, right in terms of voice talent being able to realise this amazing world. So it was riding high on so much positivity and from what I found online when I was looking at early reviews for years ago. Yeah, positive reviews, right. People saying, you know, this game looks good, some concerns, but it&rsquo;s beta. And I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;re going to fix it. But then what were your memories of its launch?
Taylor
Debacle. You know, this is this is a bad question to ask me because I played it on a. On a a graphics card with 6 gigabytes.
Craig
You&rsquo;re the perfect person device name. And because it was pictured at A at a kind of it we play.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
On every for every and it.
Taylor
It function perfectly. Ohh did it yeah cause that there were no issues in my playthrough.
Craig
Right. What was the? What was the story, though that that came out with its initial ones playthrough though, which your experiences not speak?
Taylor
To well, other people said that it was completely broken and they couldn&rsquo;t start playing it. It would just crash to desktop all the time. All of the intended things just wouldn&rsquo;t work.
Craig
And there was so much bad press that even Sony said. If you want.
Taylor
We&rsquo;re going to remove it from the store.
Craig
Yeah, we&rsquo;re going to move from the store and also even if you&rsquo;ve already started playing it, we&rsquo;ll refund your your.
Speaker
1st of it.
Taylor
To be fair, I played on the PC so.
Craig
Hmm. PC Master race represent, but you&rsquo;ve you&rsquo;re also playing now on the switch.
Taylor
Exactly. Yeah. To now.
Craig
Yeah, well.
Taylor
That, like man, the games and they&rsquo;re expensive. They are really expensive, but it it it operates well like it it&rsquo;s fully. There&rsquo;s no issues with it at all. However, they just brought out a new patch. Where all of the cars can self drive themselves, and apparently they&rsquo;re like.
Speaker
Yes.
Taylor
You know, driving into each other or not driving at all and issues like that.
Craig
Yes and no. I have. Yeah. And that&rsquo;s the kind of GTA many. Yeah. And many people playing at that version of the car, being able to auto drive. So you can take in the amazing visuals in this in this game.
Taylor
There&rsquo;s still issues ongoing now.
Craig
Setting. So what I want to so that&rsquo;s the kind of setup and it&rsquo;s since gone on to be very successful, I&rsquo;d say, I mean over those last four or five years, it&rsquo;s gone on to address most of those problems and now it is considered, you know, one of the best games to to play. The If you&rsquo;re into kind of action RPG games. Yeah. So I&rsquo;ve very much been enjoying it, but what really confronted me as I was playing it was how much it evoked my enjoyments growing up in the 80s and 90s. Of a particular view of what that future is gonna be like. As many people were afraid of and excited about the Asia century approach right that this was going to be the like from the 20th viewpoint of the late 20th century. So the the 90s in particular that with the rise of anime and before that in the.
Speaker
Hmm.
Craig
80&rsquo;s the dominance of particularly the Japanese automobile industry and other high tech aspects coming out of Japan that that 21st century is going to be Japan, century and Asia was on the rise. Within that was a backlash against it. Yeah. Where you had films like Blade Runner? In particular, that portrayed this future and of course drawing upon the inspiration of cyberpunk, which is Neuromancer by William Gibson.
Speaker
Sure.
Craig
That I read and. Enjoyed anyway? The sense was, though, that that there was. A A fear of Japan, a fear of. Asia, which was. Wound up in this concept, techno Orientalism. Which looks at how the West often portrays East Asia in particular, and during the 90s and 80s, Japan and China. As you know, both being hyper technological but also very weird, very culturally exotic. And so you have all these stereotypes. And anxieties about Asia&rsquo;s economic and technological dominance? I don&rsquo;t know if anyone here remembers the 1980s Michael Keaton film in Australia. It was called working class man in America. It was released as Gung Ho. But that was all about a declining America. In. Automobile factory that got bought out by a Japanese company in the 80s that wanted to come in and bring Japanese management structure and it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s got a lot of racism, a lot of culture clash, but it&rsquo;s very emblematic of that techno orientalist vibe where you have this, yes. Highly technologically developed, but all the Japanese are automatons. They&rsquo;re all soulless kind of racism within that field. Aspects of that are also in the kind of world of Blade Runner. Mm-hmm. But before we go any further, we have got some. Some comments. Ohh yeah. Good from Big Boy natty. Wonderful to have Big boy needy back on. Good afternoon. Dot Norris, dad and mysterious person in the quarter. Great. Yes, we do try to get some mysterious guests.
Speaker
Yeah.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
In. Big Boy needy asks. What&rsquo;s the gameplay like in comparison to other games like GTA5 or like Kingdom come, deliverance, etcetera. You&rsquo;ve got more experience than I do. Taylor, you want to handle this one with Skyrim?
Taylor
Yeah. Well, I would say it was. So my favourite game of all time, of course, is Skyrim, but this one comes as a close second. Because it is quite similar. However, it does have the you know the the the first person shooter thing which Skyrim doesn&rsquo;t have, and so I would say it&rsquo;s closer to GTA in that regards, but you cannot go into third person.
Craig
Yeah. And that that was part of the initial scepticism of some missteps at the time. I mean, I please find, I mean that first person many people say is is actually creates more immersiveness in the game space.
Taylor
In the game. Yeah. But it&rsquo;s only when you like put it off against which of which all of that was only third person, and those things only first person.
Speaker 4
Yeah.
Craig
The point that was made by many critics of this move was that it it just weird, given how important the coolness your character design is in the game that you get.
Speaker
Of.
Craig
So much customization for clothing and you get cool points that you can develop your character. Around and they want your character. They want you to spend time on your character design to make it look cool. But then of course you don&rsquo;t see it often in the game unless it&rsquo;s through. A mirror, yeah. Or yeah, in in passing or if you&rsquo;re jumping into a vehicle and you do that back for the backwards you. But yeah, game play is good. I mean, I go to, I mean, it&rsquo;s one of those games theorist here at UTAS, referred to it as the Ludo Drome. Yeah, where the more you play these immersive world building games, the more you can start seeing the world around you through the HUD. Right. You start seeing like I I kind of think I&rsquo;m in the cyberpunk hard or wouldn&rsquo;t it be cool if the cyberpunk card was here as I&rsquo;m walking to McDonald&rsquo;s and then they can scan people and like, you know, this is from gang X or if I&rsquo;m in the car and I&rsquo;m thinking, you know, if I.
Taylor
This is ridiculous and this is and I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking about.
Craig
Playing Grand Theft Auto or Cyberpunk 2077? I could just flip a UI right here and speed off stuff. These, I mean, I mean, it&rsquo;s a game fictional space, obviously, I know what the difference between reality and.
Taylor
Fiction is it doesn&rsquo;t sound like.
Craig
That, but then you find it. Sometimes you&rsquo;re in a hub world and you spend a lot of time there. Some people in first person shooters. Inactive. That they&rsquo;ll stop playing the game and they&rsquo;ll still see the the blip for the gun sight in their vision.
Taylor
Well, that&rsquo;s the the Tetris effect, isn&rsquo;t it?
Craig
Right, they&rsquo;ll see it. Right. Yeah. So what is the Tetris effect? For those that.
Taylor
I don&rsquo;t know you if you play Tetris for more than two hours or something like that. You start seeing.
Speaker
Please see there.
Taylor
The blocks coming down, yeah.
Craig
Yeah. And I think similarly, I mean big, Naughty Boy says. Yes. I mean kind of agree, Craig. Thank you. I&rsquo;ve experienced. Thank you. Yes.
Taylor
You&rsquo;re both mental.
Craig
Well, one of Tasmania&rsquo;s greatest living authors, shirt Taloon and his book he who fights with monsters, is all about that concept of a guy that travels through a portal to another world, and his only advantage is that he is. The world has recreated him, but given him. Video game HUD. Interface with the the world he&rsquo;s in, so he he uses a chat and he has a map that pops up and he can bring up his storage devices. I was thinking what a what a fantastic idea. If I mean I guess that&rsquo;s Google glasses, right? If you could interact with the world around you with a game hub interface. And you can get storage items out of things into storage.
Taylor
Ohh no absolutely I cause cause they&rsquo;ve got the the things that you can put in the on the dashboard of your car and it it. It flashes it up onto the windshields of like.
Craig
Yeah, it&rsquo;s.
Taylor
Direction. You need to go in order to follow. Google Maps I&rsquo;ve always wanted.
Craig
You test researcher from sociology did a project looking at gamers who played GTA back in the day, and he&rsquo;s interviewed locally here in Hobart, was asking them after the game after you&rsquo;ve played the game, does it make you see Hobart? Or in a different way, and some of them recounted that experience of. You know, I&rsquo;d like to, you know, drive down this one way St if I was in the game. So you&rsquo;re starting to see the cityscape as more international as well. One guy was saying I thought Hobart was really boring, but then I&rsquo;m playing GTA. I realised there are aspects of Hobart which I like the gang world of GTA, driving down hungry Jacks. And there were three kids, he&rsquo;d think.
Taylor
OK. Yeah, yeah. And he could have just leaped out of the car and slit their throats slight there, yeah.
Craig
That would be gang gang XI. Get the money. Obviously. We&rsquo;re saying make sure you do reality and fiction, but it made for some people. See Hobart as a world engaged globally whereas.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
As you know, there are dark parts of Hobart, just like you could do a GTA Hobart.
Taylor
This is this is just for people who have got no imagination. I&rsquo;m.
Craig
No, no, no.
Taylor
Sorry.
Craig
No, it makes the space around them more exciting through their imagination. Yeah, they&rsquo;re super imagination.
Taylor
You think about that without playing a game.
Craig
I can make.
Taylor
Whenever I drive down the street, I think about running people.
Craig
That would be more worrying to me. Alright, I wanna go back to find some key times here. So techno Orientalism, there&rsquo;s a there&rsquo;s a a clip here.
Speaker 6
What&rsquo;s the future?
Craig
Yeah.
Speaker 6
Look like this question is at the flow. Of countless people.
Craig
OK, this clip here that I&rsquo;ll play second of that just defines the key aspects of technology. So listen to this for a second. This is from my seats for an assignment they had to do for university. Good on them.
Speaker 6
So you probably know that there&rsquo;s another common element in the genre. The Asian influences. Most of the most popular cyberpunk film shows or video games take heavy influence from Asian, particularly East Asian architecture, language, culture, and more. In fact, this concept is common enough that the name techno Orientalism. Or sometimes cyber Orientalism has been made for it. But before I dive into this trope, let&rsquo;s talk about how it relates to Orientalism.
Craig
So last week on the show, we covered Orientalism. With the great. Episode of the Shadow the the Temple bills of Nabon well, I think is how it&rsquo;s pronounced within that fake Indian country. They had their other characters.
Speaker
MHM.
Taylor
Ohh yeah, the really boring.
Craig
One. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I didn&rsquo;t realise. And it&rsquo;s about to talk about here. It&rsquo;s all about a snake charmer, right? And of course, the concept of Orientalism came about through Edward Saeed and the cover of most. Hmm. Of the books. Orient was made would say feature that picture of the snake charmer, which is considered one of the classic oriental stripes because it&rsquo;s the Wests version of what the Orient is right it has these, you know, kind of your. Arabian carpets and a young boy with the snake hypnotising it and kind of 18th century sheiks in their clothing and then nonsensical writing, which is just meant to evoke it. But again, it&rsquo;s an idea of nonsensical. If you&rsquo;re actually from those regions you wouldn&rsquo;t identify. Or experience any of that painting. But from a western perspective, you have no experience of. It and that. Says Ohh, how perfectly exotic. Anyway, let&rsquo;s hear first the definition of Orientalism. Sure.
Speaker 6
Orientalism can be summed up pretty well by French artist Jean Elijah Holmes 1879, painting the snake charmer, the image and bodies, Western misguided ideas of the Orient going as far as to include writings on the wall that are in fact utter gibberish. So Orientalism, the idea was coined by Edward Saeed in 1978 as a way of referring to the general. Othering of Middle Eastern, Asian and North African societies, whereas the oxidant, the word referring to Western societies, was represented as normal and standard. The Orient was a backwards deviation from the norm. In his then controversial book, Orientalism said talks about how within writing, those from the Occident were portrayed as heroes and those from the Orient as inferior villains.
Craig
So it was very much what we had in last week&rsquo;s episode with the Shadow where the Western guy who went to India got trained up. With the special. Indian shadow techniques? Yeah, brought that back rationally, but he&rsquo;s the good guy because he&rsquo;s the white guy. And then you had the drug den Indian. Evil guys who are trying to get the, you know, the mayor&rsquo;s son hooked on opium and.
Taylor
But you have to think at that time what were the places that were in the Orient, what were their stories? Yeah. And look. And with the the the White McDonald&rsquo;s eating rice.
Craig
Yeah. And this is where the South Bank genre is is really interesting because that we finally do get that. Experience reflected back upon us, where just as we did Blade Runner, we just as American creators. Like Ridley Scott and.
Speaker
Have. A.
Craig
White Anglocentric creators, their version from a western perspective of what Asia is you&rsquo;ve got Akira and Ghost, and you&rsquo;re coming out of Japan articulating the same setting cyberpunk, but fundamentally reoriented from a Japanese point of view. Some of that is self orientalist, right? So you&rsquo;ve got some self exoticism.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
There. So you&rsquo;ve got some geisha robots, which was? Very much being that troupe of Orientalist, you know, seductive, beautiful, passive these and other.
Taylor
Also that that that&rsquo;s part of of their national identity. That&rsquo;s like having kangaroo robots, yeah.
Craig
Sure. Look, I mean it, it can be, I mean, I guess The thing is that how many people in those. Countries have first-hand experiences of. That that is it actually reflective of the lived experience which is. Of.
Taylor
Such as here with Kangaroos.
Craig
Which is where many Australians become so outraged that the stereotype that is portrayed on Australia, that it doesn&rsquo;t reflect the fact that most of us live in cities and not in the Bush equally. What&rsquo;s interesting with Ghost in the shell, for instance, is if you have a look at where they set.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
The future it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s the Japanese version of Hong Kong. So goes and the show is set in a kind of, you know, very Hong Kong looking future. Not really a Japan looking future. So they&rsquo;ve orientalized Asia in a very interesting way in that film. Big boy. Needy has replied back. Do you want to read that please?
Taylor
Says immersive gameplay does definitely make life a bit more alive after living a day to day life. Where it&rsquo;s all the same and then play GTA where you can do anything. It makes it more alive.
Craig
Which always just be interested in those farming simulators or the what&rsquo;s it like on Roblox? There&rsquo;s a number of garden, yeah. How how far are you through on that one?
Taylor
Grow. I don&rsquo;t really play it. No. OK. Wow, wow.
Craig
Yeah. OK, pushing on.
Speaker
And he lead hundreds of millions of. Men to sweep the world. And that, my friend, is what you have. Got to prevent.
Speaker 6
It&rsquo;s worth mentioning here that Orientalism can refer to the othering of a variety of places, but in this video I&rsquo;m talking specifically about Asia, and usually more specifically about East Asia. Orientalist imagery is still prevalent in pop culture, from the use of ninja costumes on Halloween to kimonos on stage, but there is debate as to whether these acts are racist. In themselves, they are almost always fantastical and inaccurate. As Pedro Jacobelli writes about a film.
Craig
So yeah, I mean it is that whole debate around, you know, your cosplay is my culture and cultural appropriation.
Taylor
But not even cosplay as well, cause I was in a theatre production in 2017 or something like that where we had it was Japan, Japan sort of themed Macbeth? If if it was like Macbeth, if it was in.
Speaker
Oh really?
Taylor
Japan really. Yeah.
Craig
There&rsquo;s a great Kurosawa film trends of blood. Which is that right? It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a samurai version of.
Taylor
Yeah, yeah, yeah. It it was that sort of sort of thing. So yeah, we learned how to do sort of like samurai sword fighting styles and things like that. We had Tycho players come in and do the soundtrack behind everything and our costumes were kimonos and yukatas. And they were sort of.
Craig
Ohh, fantastic.
Taylor
Specifically, not fantastical or anything. Well, the witches, of course, were fantastical because they were based off the one that crawls out of the TV screen the the rings, yeah.
Craig
The ring? Really. You did surgical.
Taylor
But all of the other people. So I I played a a few other different characters but all of my costume was sort of downplayed, sort of more traditional rather than fantastical.
Craig
Right. So you&rsquo;re like, you know, you cut the yeah kind of Japanese. Bathroom. Yes. So Orientalist of me to say that. But again, you know that that that would have copped. You copped some some. Friction there some, some, some some.
Taylor
We we. Yeah, we were scared about it. But yeah, there was no, no issues with it at all, because I guess we&rsquo;d had just done it in a really sort of.
Craig
Tasteful. OK. Yeah, yeah. No one there. Performing was Japanese.
Speaker 5
No.
Craig
But again, many people might. Some people would say it. It can be an effective entry point, right to provide more interest in that space or a form of soft power, right? Isn&rsquo;t it? I mean for. Instance, you know.
Taylor
You&rsquo;re talking about an effective entry point to racism.
Craig
Trying out more about the complexity.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
That really is part of Japan and I guess if you&rsquo;re upfront that this is a, as they&rsquo;re saying here, if it&rsquo;s if it&rsquo;s kind of hyper fictional and hyper stylized, often that can help avoid that appropriate.
Taylor
Yeah.
Speaker
Hmm.
Taylor
Recently.
Craig
Monkey, but yeah, well, yeah, yeah. I mean, well that in its own way was an appropriation of Chinese clothing from the Japanese point of view.
Taylor
Exactly, yeah.
Craig
UM. Yes, but again, in in the the point you were doing it was a. Little more downplayed.
Taylor
Yeah, yeah.
Craig
Very interesting if yeah, that, that, that didn&rsquo;t cop any Orientalist.
Taylor
Backlash. I&rsquo;ve got a video, but if you wanna. Watch it. It&rsquo;s good fun.
Craig
Next episode, next episode. Alright, so what&rsquo;s techno orientalism? So we&rsquo;ll quickly jump into a definition of techno Orientalism.
Speaker 6
Techno Orientalism differs a bit from Edward Saeed&rsquo;s definition of Orientalism. Instead of seeing Asia as just backwards and uncivilised, techno Orientalism represents Asia as so technologically advanced that it has no humanity. Asian people can still be framed as intellectually inferior, but the key distinction is that they&rsquo;re now also hyper technological. Making them supposedly emotionless and. Newman, in their book techno Orientalism, Imagining Asia and speculative fiction, history and media, David S Rao, Betsy Huang, and Greta Igneo write that this presents a juxtaposition of cultural retrograde with technical hyper advancement. The message of techno Orientalism is actually a little contradictory, since it portrays ancient people as both terrifyingly intelligent. As well as uncivilised and culturally behind techno, Orientalism means using Asian more specifically East Asian cultures, as a signifier of the future. This isn&rsquo;t just any future, though. It&rsquo;s cyberpunk, thus a dystopian future. These films tend to have a white guy battling against a corrupt system or corporation in a city full of indicators of East Asian.
Craig
So a couple of interesting points raised there. One of the species of it is this contradiction. So rather than Orientalism, which is set as you know, the East is underdeveloped, exotic and mystical and irrational, and the West is hyper. Enhanced and rational in techno orientalism. It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s in many. Ways flipped where Asia is. Now, the technologically advanced space. But the criticism of Azure in that space, particularly if we&rsquo;re looking at the 1980s with the rise of particularly automate of companies, is that it&rsquo;s also dehumanising that they work like robots. They&rsquo;re are kind of an ants like people that just, you know, support. Labour and again, this would be the racist discourse around othering.
Taylor
Yes.
Craig
And and the fear of of of, of that cultural other.
Taylor
Yeah, it it it. It&rsquo;s also a a Trumpian fear of the country being taken over as well, because if you look at Knight City, it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s set in America and then it&rsquo;s got all of this sort of Asian influence from it of like you.
Craig
Know and and you know within the game you could certainly criticise the. At at a sucker. Company as as emblematic of that, that that&rsquo;s a. Company which is. Very much that fear of Asian power that it&rsquo;s going to be kind of not based on Western values that will be based on this idea of a Japanese values which is full of loyalty and honour and tradition and working for the company. And you know, you don&rsquo;t mean. Anything the company means everything.
Taylor
And what&rsquo;s it called? Where it&rsquo;s fairly all piety as well.
Craig
Yeah, yeah. And again, there&rsquo;s a there&rsquo;s a. There&rsquo;s a stereotypes of experiences which don&rsquo;t reflect the lived experience. That is the complexity of the Japanese space. But nevertheless, is the stereotype there. So so aspects of Cyberpunk 2077 certainly replicate that. I just want to play though what I think is really a counterpoint for that is that you have the character of tacky murder. Right. Who&rsquo;s the bodyguard of the emperor? Right, the yeah.
Taylor
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Craig
Saka.
Taylor
The.
Craig
But there&rsquo;s a lot of his his character is quite complex, so if we listen to like I&rsquo;ll, I&rsquo;ll play a short clip of his back story. Yeah, where it&rsquo;s really conveying his humanity. Right. His sense of the struggle that he&rsquo;s had, he&rsquo;s not just a a villainous character or a.
Taylor
Dialogue.
Craig
You know, side quest. Yes, dude.
Speaker 4
I remember the chemical stench of the canal where we boys washed our shirts. Corporate transporters sometimes passed through our slab arasaka, selecting children, but only the clean ones or Osaka gave me what no one else could values I could honour live for. This was most important. You dirty your hands. Full money. I in the name of a priest.
Speaker
So as you can probably see.
Craig
So as you. Probably see sorry, that&rsquo;s actually from. A YouTube clip from the Kavanagh Cle called the anti Japanese Racism and Orientalism of Cyberpunk from Blade Runner to Cyberpunk 2077. His you choose basically ripping it apart saying it is full of racist stereotypes. He loves this world setting but he. It highly problematic and I agree with some of the criticism, as the outer cycle 1 is is pretty much playing into that trope of the villainous, you know, Shogun empire, that. But I think Tucker Tucker&rsquo;s character is is complex, is full of kind of remorse.
Speaker
Buddha.
Craig
And a sense of exploitation he&rsquo;d suffered. You know, he&rsquo;s not just a cardboard cut out villain. In fact, he becomes a a helpful guy.
Speaker
Right.
Craig
Throughout this.
Taylor
World The funny thing to me is that it it&rsquo;s negative if you frame it as a dystopia, and in many ways it is a dystopia. However, when I look in that world, I I want to.
Speaker
So.
Taylor
Be in there.
Craig
What is it about the world that?
Taylor
Appeals to you. It&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s just so. Like you know, technologically advanced, I want to be in a world that technology technologically advanced, no matter what.
Craig
Yeah, and and in. Many ways, that&rsquo;s what I was thinking about in terms of their aspects of the hub and. Your interface in that world.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
Like the net running, you can do which is where your character can. Has got various cyber cyber implants which means they can hack into security systems and be able to see through security cameras and switch them off. And again when I see security cameras like I&rsquo;ve seen a couple of security cameras walking around today and I&rsquo;ve thought wow if I was a net.
Taylor
Well.
Craig
Tanner, I could just hack into that camera.
Taylor
So that&rsquo;s why you when we went down, the thing seems like that is a good that is a good sign. Yeah.
Craig
It&rsquo;s.
Taylor
It was like the first time you&rsquo;ve ever pointed that out and we&rsquo;ve gone there 100 times and I was like, so confused you were like.
Speaker
Sure.
Taylor
CCTV camera over there.
Craig
Good location for it. That that&rsquo;s their location because you&rsquo;ve got the passion. Powerful. Gonna we be able to pick up an accident or something? And I&rsquo;m only tuned into that cause in the game whenever I come across a group of people that I need to take care of, I&rsquo;m always. Trying to find. Where the cameras are first to then hack into the cameras, locate where the rest of the people are that are going.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
To have to take care of. And then I&rsquo;ve been doing that. In real life. Yeah. Just I&rsquo;ll walk into a space and say where are the security cameras here? Yeah. And it has made me really sensitive to how many security cameras are around us. And again, that&rsquo;s part of the cyberpunk world that you&rsquo;re in a highly. Surveyed society and yeah, I agree with your sense of the fun of the immersiveness of it, that. And that&rsquo;s the punkness of cyberpunk, they say right where the cyber is. It&rsquo;s high tech, but the punk is it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s your working class, your people on the streets that are using that corporate technology. For themselves, right, so your chart. Peter gets to hack into the corporate security cameras to then use those to defend himself with.
Taylor
But of course your character can also be corporate.
Craig
Too. Well, that&rsquo;s where the power is. The ultimate power in these worlds, where where it&rsquo;s dystopic is that you know, you don&rsquo;t have a welfare system, you don&rsquo;t have anyone helping you. You don&rsquo;t have any supports in this space. The companies own you and the companies own the power.
Taylor
The thing that I really like about it is that even though it is so high tech and there&rsquo;s all of this amazing stuff everywhere, there&rsquo;s still just rubbish on the.
Craig
Ground. It&rsquo;s a really healthy world. Yeah. Yeah. Look and. And it does have that wonderfully worn world building to it. And which is why I always prefer the world.
Taylor
It is.
Craig
Building of Star Wars to Star Trek while while Star Trek is is a fantastic universe. Nevertheless, the kind of alien world the Blade Runner world, the Star Wars world is all about used technology which is partly damaged. It has storytelling within that. Big boy Nadia sent another.
Taylor
Ohh sent. Another two said, he said. I&rsquo;ve heard of people being called racist for wearing traditional Chinese outfits, whereas actual Chinese people are fine with.
Speaker
Message.
Craig
It look and that&rsquo;s one thing I found when I was looking into information about Cyberpunk 2077 and that.
Taylor
And that so some people from the future have said it&rsquo;s OK.
Craig
People in 20. We have 2077 time travellers, have said. Great people from Japan who have commented about it, as well as some of the reviews online have been positive about how the use of Japanese language is spot on in the cityscape. The the katakana and English blurring that&rsquo;s there is is more evolved than it is in Japan. Like you have hatcho and then. Kadu in karaka. So they&rsquo;ve quite enjoyed the accuracy to the the written system.
Taylor
And if if you like, stand up on the top of a building, you can see karaoke everywhere. Which is the true? Family man.
Craig
Family Mart. So there is a sense of also some sense of, you know, the the the soft power of Japan that you know in the 80s. Yes, Japan was on the rise and in many ways, maybe it was lucky they&rsquo;ve got that as a cultural soft power like the.
Speaker
Hmm.
Craig
Positive image people have of a country from around the world, far worse ones to be stuck with than than cyberpunk. I mean the Kangaroos and crocodile man hunter.
Taylor
Yeah. Like. And how about fermented fish from like Norway? Things like that.
Craig
Yeah. What about Vikings storming?
Taylor
Yeah. Yeah, exactly.
Craig
Yeah. Yeah. So in in many ways, yeah, many of the reviews of said Punk, 2077 from Japanese players and. Game reviewers in Japan were positive in terms of, much like Big Boy Natty saying not taking offence at this, but seeing it as actually yeah, culturally tuned as opposed to I guess the bad press that the Assassin&rsquo;s Creed, Japan one.
Taylor
A positive spin on it.
Craig
Where some of the lettering was wrong, where it was just there as an orientalist touch.
Taylor
And they didn&rsquo;t allow you to break grave sites either. Whatever it was.
Craig
Probably a good thing. But also the voice acting is good, right? I mean, you&rsquo;ve got a good Japanese voice acting there.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
What&rsquo;s the second point? I can&rsquo;t read it from here. Your point. It&rsquo;s depicted as a dystopia, but it doesn&rsquo;t need to be. Maybe. Make Brisbane into S Hunk city and it might be fine. Just a normal technological city. Yeah, if you did so in this environment, of course, you&rsquo;ve got Japan town. Which is kind of like Chinatown that exists in some of the largest city. Which does provide you that sense of cultural hybridity that that food is engaged with and celebrated. Were there any other? I mean, it&rsquo;d be interesting. Yeah. Cyberpunk Brisbane, cyberpunk. But.
Taylor
Cyberpunk cover.
Craig
That&rsquo;s I mean. I kind of think you could do steampunk.
Taylor
Hobarts. Ohh yeah.
Craig
Because we&rsquo;ve got. A lot of old.
Taylor
Colonial buildings. Yeah, we just don&rsquo;t have the high rises that you need for a cyberpunk city.
Craig
I mean with Dark **** it kind of gets swept away in some neon.
Taylor
I suppose.
Craig
Right, that neon scape which is I think also the pleasure of Cyberpunk 2077, is that neon cityscape space.
Speaker
Hmm.
Craig
Well, we&rsquo;ve got about two or three minutes left. So we we we might return to some of these themes in the future because I&rsquo;ve got so much more to talk about. But I mean for me, I guess the job and I have had for Cyberpunk 2077 is that they&rsquo;ve gone back to the 80s version of that world. So I I started off as a nomad. And and you&rsquo;re. Yeah, that&rsquo;s how I.
Taylor
Cool.
Craig
Roll. I&rsquo;m very mad. Max. And you start with an 80s car. That&rsquo;s been kind of mad. Max stuff a bit. And and I felt that was an immediate entry point to me in terms of this is this is a a kind of 80s as if everything went off the rails, right. Yeah. Right. So you&rsquo;ve still got a lot of that that temperament and and and and. Cultural climate from the 80s so that the version of Japan Town is very much a kind of what if Japan continued its success up as opposed to the economic downturn in Turkey in the in the early?
Taylor
90S is this funny because I&rsquo;ve I&rsquo;ve played through the game twice now, so I started off on PC and now doing switch of course. For PC I started as a Corpo.
Craig
Right. It&rsquo;s the kind of corporate.
Taylor
And. Yeah. And for switch, I did the street kids. So I haven&rsquo;t done the the Nomad 1.
Craig
Street kid the. Yeah, the Mad Max one. Yeah, right. That&rsquo;s quite an old punk.
Taylor
He&rsquo;s got a. Mohawk. Brilliant.
Craig
Yeah, it looks totally out of place in. The city, but. And I guess that would be cyberpunk. Three, which is mad. Max. Australia. Yeah, yeah, right. It actually is not neon based, but all about, you know, these these tyranny of distance deserts and your punk. Kind of. Not steam, but you know, 80s diesel technology.
Taylor
Yeah. Yeah, diesel punk.
Craig
Yeah. Yeah. Where it&rsquo;s all about, you know, you&rsquo;ve got a crossbow on your forehand and. Slightly mediaeval yeah vibe to it, but yeah, that&rsquo;s probably Australia&rsquo;s strongest sci-fi image. Yeah, Mad Max. Well, again, thanks, big Boy native been part of the conversation. One would have some audience engagement ring. You want to sign us out with the tune? Again, I think that really evokes cyberpunk.
Taylor
And it really resolved.
Craig
Resolve. Thank you so much. So thanks Taylor for.
Taylor
Being on, no worries.
Craig
We&rsquo;ll get you on with the switch and we&rsquo;ll do a live. Let&rsquo;s play some point, OK? It&rsquo;s been Craig for media mothership for another week. You can find further show notes.
Taylor
OK, sure.
Craig
Up on our.
Taylor
Podcast please, please just use the mouse on that first. Oh.
Craig
There we go. Yes, the trackball, which is very cyberpunk.
Taylor
Yeah, it is, yeah.
Craig
In in. Vibe. We&rsquo;ve got some great music coming up. Inevitably, we&rsquo;ll have Taylor show team for aeroplane.
Taylor
At some point I I need to just to just finish my website cause that&rsquo;s the whole reason I need to have people being able to send me tracks, so I need to finish the website.
Craig
Yep, Yep. Well, we&rsquo;ve been practising on the kalimba kalimba kalimba. The Kalambo Kalambo kalimba.
Speaker
Yeah.
Craig
Coming up now is FOMO by tan. By what?
Taylor
By what?
