And, of course, we cover the latest news in media and popular culture.</p>

I was playing Ohh. What is it? Launceston townsfolk?
Craig
Right. So you had. Era appropriate clothing for the.
Taylor
Ohh yeah, I was ninja. I had sideburns which I grew out for six months.
Craig
For the sold really great. Really. Yeah. So you played the role of a British soldier? Yes or yeah, one of and. You were an extra, though, so you were. You weren&rsquo;t. You didn&rsquo;t have any.
Taylor
Speaking roles, not not a speaking role. No, but but it was a credited extra.
Craig
OK.
Taylor
Which is. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m on IMDb, etcetera.
Craig
No kidding, Taylor. IMDb is that the one role at the moment?
Taylor
That appears, yeah, yeah.
Craig
Yeah, we&rsquo;ll have to add a couple of episodes.
Taylor
Of course.
Craig
All right, great. So. In a way, you&rsquo;ve played a type of villain. Would you say that? Identity was from the point of view of some characters, would be seen. As a villain, no. Really. I mean wouldn&rsquo;t, wouldn&rsquo;t, wouldn&rsquo;t there be some characters in that film that would see? The British. Army as villains though.
Taylor
Yeah, but yeah, well, I haven&rsquo;t seen the movie, but I&rsquo;m just guessing from history. There is like so it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s difficult because there&rsquo;s the the main villain played by Sam Claflin, the fellow who plays Finnick in The Hunger Games. He&rsquo;s the main villain and.
Speaker 4
OK.
Craig
Is he British officer?
Speaker
That&rsquo;s.
Taylor
Irish.
Craig
Right. Is this soldier or?
Taylor
Well, sort of like Irish sort of thing. And we basically he gets found out to have molested this sort of slave girl, I guess. And we all just look at him and he&rsquo;s being publicly humiliated through that. So technically against the villain, I guess in a way.
Craig
That was the scene you&rsquo;re in, right? So the scene you&rsquo;re in, you want part of villainous Hanks. OK, OK, well, villain adjacent.
Taylor
Sort of thing. Yeah, yeah. Villains Jason. Well, actually no, for that role I had to. They gave us a pipe and we had. To smoke a pipe.
Craig
How did you smoke a pipe? Do you smoke? No. So how did you do the?
Taylor
Fake smoke. I just like drew it into my cheeks and then puffed it. Out.
Craig
Well, ruining the magic of movies your own media mothership.
Taylor
Oh yeah.
Craig
So indeed, as that little segue to introduce the show has foretold, omnium mothership we look at how the media shapes our world around us and we love these moments of behind the scenes how the sausage is made experiences so not actual smoking, but fake smoking.
Taylor
OK.
Craig
For that scene. We&rsquo;ll be continuing last week&rsquo;s discussion of villains, so we&rsquo;ll unpack a little bit more. What makes a good villain?
Taylor
So just give me a moment I&rsquo;ve forgotten to pay for parking.
Craig
And. That&rsquo;s a villainous act, isn&rsquo;t it? Yeah. You&rsquo;re still in character. I notice. And in your acting, I know you played good guys. You were a detective in an Agatha Christie.
Taylor
It is. Yeah, that was on stage.
Craig
Yeah, on stage. Have you done any stage performances which are villain bees?
Taylor
I&rsquo;m trying to think. Yes, I was murderer too in Macbeth.
Craig
Great. Alright, so that&rsquo;s.
Taylor
I was in. I was in.
Craig
A sword fight that is so fantastic, drawing upon those experiences or that experience. Yeah, we&rsquo;re going to explore your thoughts on what makes some good villains in cinema. Probably you&rsquo;ve not seen most of. The movies, so that&rsquo;s part of. The fun? Yeah, of course, Harry Potter.
Taylor
Is this? I&rsquo;ve seen it.
Craig
You have right so you can as we&rsquo;re talking about this topic. Feel free to SMS US on 0488811707. We&rsquo;re also on YouTube and Twitch. You can post a message on the chat there well in the future in the future, yeah. So all that more. But before we do that, let&rsquo;s cover.
Taylor
Patreon. Of beer.
Craig
Some some news. Oh, that&rsquo;s not cheat.
Taylor
It is tuned. You just played it wrong.
Craig
Alright, really interesting article from Cydia. What&rsquo;s that comic book were you all? The same thing.
Taylor
OK.
Speaker
Yeah.
Craig
Anyway, Superman Toy confirms identity of a mysterious character. Fans have been debating for months. The reason why I quite like this article was it&rsquo;s one of these classic movements with the with the paratext. So you&rsquo;ve got the text, the film, the new Superman movie that&rsquo;s around the corner, and then you got these spin-off properties, right. So the movie poster, the Happy Meal, McDonald&rsquo;s meal thing, games.
Taylor
Game. Is there a thing?
Craig
All that stuff usually comes out with a big movie. And they&rsquo;re referred to as paratext. Or maybe a bit of transmedia, right? It goes to a different format like. In this case, the toy line. And it&rsquo;s one of these wonderful moments where, again, you have the forensic fandom ideas, so fans are out there forensically sorting through content to get the kind of gotcha moment or the reveal moment to get a little bit of cultural capital from their other fans to say, hey, look what I&rsquo;ve discovered. This one is is a toy line, right? And it&rsquo;s happened numerous occasions where the toy line has a bit of publicity leading up to the film, and lo and behold, it reveals a character which had been, you know, rumoured or held off on in the.
Taylor
Trailer. So is it like a character? That&rsquo;s suited up and then you can take the helmet off.
Craig
Or something. I know in the past there&rsquo;s been cases of of that level of reveal in terms of, OK, bringing this character back. Even though the producers had hoped to keep it a secret, so it&rsquo;s a big surprise when you&rsquo;re watching the film. I won&rsquo;t. I won&rsquo;t spoil it for people by going into what this article proclaims.
Taylor
Really. Really. Do you think anyone in Hobart is actually going to be buying one of these?
Craig
The toy line has revealed. Global reach man for Kansas, Kansas listeners in America. OK, but yeah, nevertheless, fun moment where you know, you&rsquo;re kind of big. See where it gets revealed. From a flyer.
Taylor
I mean, this is just great radio, you could. You&rsquo;ve just said that there&rsquo;s this big secret of something and then you haven&rsquo;t revealed anything of it. Wow.
Craig
Kotaku next article from Kotaku. Ubisoft explains.
Taylor
Is there anything from Gizmondo today?
Craig
I got IGN and and anyway OK. Sorry, that&rsquo;s spoiling. Ubisoft explains why you can&rsquo;t kill animals in assassin Creed Shadows. The game.
Taylor
I mean, that&rsquo;s just basic. You should be able. To kill everything in it.
Craig
The game director decides. OK, so why do you why do you think it is that in the latest Assassin&rsquo;s Creed, the one that&rsquo;s set in Japan, the. Game designers made an effort so.
Taylor
Is it something to do with animal spirits? No, no, OK. They just couldn&rsquo;t be bothered to animate it.
Craig
Very practical. The games director cites a lack of predators in Japan and a desire to create a more Zen like open one.
Speaker
Yeah, that&rsquo;s a.
Taylor
Lack of predators in Japan, so you should be able to slice a.
Craig
Rabbit in half predators. Except for humans, the ultimate predator. Or maybe the predator, right? So again, two things there. Zenlike approached the world. So they took a A. And moral, philosophical stance to this film that they want animal lovers to enjoy. This right? No animals been harmed in the creation of this game kind of vibe that that you can&rsquo;t. You know, there&rsquo;s a lot of kittens, right? The screen capture, for instance that they&rsquo;ve got is a kitten.
Taylor
Absolute rubbish.
Craig
The your, your your neck it seems I I agree it seems I mean this game has hasn&rsquo;t creed. Shadow has been bedevilled. That&rsquo;s true by issues around. You know, dealing inappropriately with sensitive topics, for instance shrines also are non damageable and this was based on controversy earlier on where you know I think there&rsquo;s been some incorrect lettering, the strains. You&rsquo;re incorrect anyway, a whole series of issues have before in this in terms of, you know, kind of political economy, a sense that this is politically insensitive or cultural preparation. Anyway, this is the latest one that the game review was saying. They were surprised to find the player can never attack or kill any animals in the games. Virtual recreation of feudal Japan. And they would have pride.
Taylor
That&rsquo;s crazy. I mean, even in the earliest links like Zelda games, you could cut the grass. You could eat a.
Craig
Chicken well, yeah, they say you can. However pet them and draw pictures of them.
Speaker 1
Ohh.
Craig
Unlike so many other open world games, including previous Ubisoft projects, there aren&rsquo;t even any aggressive predators, so I guess.
Taylor
Like bears and.
Craig
Yeah, like in Red Dead Redemption. It&rsquo;s not Ubisoft, but other game open world game spaces like Red Dead Redemption. You&rsquo;ll have, you know, grizzly bears. Wildcats that you know, are predators and will attack you, and so you can battle and kill them. Yeah. This one has taken the view that because the only animals you&rsquo;re going to encounter are are non predator based, right? So cats and stuff.
Taylor
Medic through CNN.
Craig
You&rsquo;re not going to be in a situation where you&rsquo;re forced to survive in that scenario like you&rsquo;re not gonna be encountering. A wolf. Or a bear. I mean, there are wolves and bears in Japan, but nevertheless in the in the locations you&rsquo;re in, I guess the temples and so forth. So yeah. Yeah. They want to send like a bridge.
Speaker 5
Hmm.
Craig
Yeah, yeah. I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s a selling points, if it&rsquo;s taking the moral high ground here. If animal lovers are really going to embrace that.
Taylor
I think it&rsquo;s just. Another nail in the coffin of that.
Craig
Game. Well, on that point, keeping the kind of video game set in Japan, IGN has an article about the the follow up series to what is it the consumer? Right, so this is ghosts of yottaa. So this is the. Next follow on game from Ghosts of Tsushima, which is set during the ****** attempted invasion in Japan. This one is the follow up, so ghost of Yokai director Val&rsquo;s to deliver a respectful representation of Japan on par.
Speaker 5
OK.
Craig
With ghosts of tashina. And again, that&rsquo;s in conversation with the failure of the Assassin&rsquo;s Creed shadows game. To effective to I mean it costs so much backlash. Hmm. So there it&rsquo;s interesting. They&rsquo;re selling point for this game is that, hey, we are the respect for game designers. We&rsquo;re going to take a lot of care to this. So again, a lot of nervousness, a lot of egg shells around the representation of Japan, which is interesting. Even I guess the prominence that period of Japan reached with the Shogun series from last year, which was a huge success. One all these awards. So you can see these game studios jumping into this space to represent it. But yeah, because of the bad publicity around. Incorrectly getting some of the details or being seen as insensitive to the handling of it. I wonder if they&rsquo;re gonna allow you to kill animals in this. Is that a? Are we being kind of? Baby cuddled a bit. You know Nanny state a bit in terms of not seeing the repercussions. I mean, the fact that humans do kill animals and that maybe we should.
Taylor
See you.
Craig
Sense the wrongness. Of that little rightness of that times.
Taylor
I mean in Skyrim for example, I got a mod which allows you to sever the parts of animals if you want. So you can then put the different parts into a pot to cook that particular part.
Craig
And I guess if you&rsquo;re trying to immerse yourself into a reality.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
Well, yeah, I guess I wouldn&rsquo;t do that. And there is this whole thing of what farm to plate in the real world, right? People have lost the idea of where food comes from, if they&rsquo;re just going to willies and seeing mints.
Taylor
Exactly.
Craig
That that we need to bring back that sense of of what the actual reality of it is, is. Has that helped you in terms of your eating habits? Do you now look at food differently?
Taylor
Yeah, yeah, I eat more meat than ever.
Craig
The meat lobby would love. Love you, all right, AIS, Technica.
Taylor
From pork on your.
Craig
Technica the Empire Strikes Back with F bombs AI Darth Vader.
Taylor
Ohh that that&rsquo;s all I wanted to talk about. There was something I I knew there was something I had.
Speaker 1
Yeah.
Taylor
This week and I wanted to talk about it.
Craig
Yeah, it&rsquo;s a big story. We we, Yep. So the subtitle here is Sith happens. This is funny. Brilliant. The Empire strike spec with F bombs AI Darth Vader goes rogue with profanity slurs Fortnite AI voice trained on James Earl Jones spoke curse words and insults before it was patched, so this of course is in a very very popular Fortnite game where you&rsquo;re. Third person well, not shooter. Third person kind of fighter. Incredibly popular. They&rsquo;ve dropped in some Star Wars characters, including Darth Vader that you can encounter. We&rsquo;ll play a clip.
Taylor
Ohh really brilliant. Great idea.
Craig
Ohh, hold on, I haven&rsquo;t. I haven&rsquo;t hooked it up. Well, eventually will. And what was your? How did you come across?
Taylor
This story ohh this was this just appeared in my sort of like news feed because that&rsquo;s what happened. You have a Samsung phone, you just swipe it to the left and it&rsquo;s got all the news that&rsquo;s been tailored specifically for you. And so yeah, I&rsquo;ve watched. I&rsquo;ve watched a couple of the. The videos, and not only did they did it speak curse words and things like that, but it started saying, oh, what did it say? Something along the lines. They always make it so they talk about Hitler and so it said something around Hitler being right, that sort of thing, I think and.
Speaker 5
Right, right, right.
Craig
OK, well I&rsquo;ve. Queued it. I&rsquo;ve kind of cued it up.
Taylor
OK. Yeah.
Speaker
What freaking ******* food is that? Darth Vader? Tell me. Ohh my God.
Speaker 1
Cool down.
Speaker 7
Freaking ******* such vulgarity does not become you, Patty. You inquire about sustenance and yet speak like a common thug.
Speaker 1
What you&rsquo;re not allowed.
Speaker 6
Oh my God. Oh my God.
Craig
So what&rsquo;s that?
Speaker 7
What sustains me?
Speaker
Oh my God, no.
Speaker 7
You. No, no, that is and it&rsquo;s composition it is.
Speaker
You made him swear.
Craig
So what&rsquo;s happening there is a gamer is making the AI Darth Vader swear because they engage in the conversation by swearing to begin with. Yeah. So she says, you know, freaking ****** eating. Food and then the Darth Vader character incorporates that language.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
Those words in their response to make it appear as if you&rsquo;re actually talking to something vaguely realistic. But unfortunately it hadn&rsquo;t been patched at all. They hadn&rsquo;t realised that if people swear that swearing gets incorporated into the answer that Darth Vader replies. So Darth Vader said something like. You know, while he recognises it&rsquo;s inappropriate, like, that&rsquo;s inappropriate, he had made to say this freaking ****** word. But he says freaking ******. So this was the controversy that it was also using the fact that it&rsquo;s James L Jones&rsquo;s voice. Right. So they&rsquo;re trained, they&rsquo;ve got the estates permission.
Speaker
Yeah.
Craig
To allow them to create a language model based on the archive of genes or juice&rsquo;s real voice. Put it in the. Team, of course, part of the conditions since. Yeah, there&rsquo;s I think there&rsquo;s legal action now being taken against them from the estate that they&rsquo;re in breach of the terms and conditions for allowing this to happen. That of course it&rsquo;s brought into some disrespect. James Silver, James&rsquo;s voice.
Speaker
Hmm.
Taylor
That is the tip of the iceberg of the bad things that it said though. I&rsquo;m pretty sure someone asked it to rank skin. Colour. No, they did and it put white as acceptable.
Craig
Really.
Speaker
So.
Taylor
Brown as unacceptable. Black is even more unacceptable. That&rsquo;s the the clip that I saw that they had, which I think is a bit more than swearing.
Craig
Yeah. It&rsquo;s horrible, isn&rsquo;t it? In a way.
Taylor
A bit more harsh when&rsquo;s weary?
Craig
Very villainous, right? So so.
Taylor
Yes, cases in character.
Craig
Also, well, yes, but also, yeah, the kind of reality there is taking advantage of the system, right. So the. These these people that are wanting to corrupt and exploit by performing offensiveness.
Taylor
But from that point it it just shows that it was definitely an AI model that had that did not have the restrictions in place that it needed. And like when they&rsquo;ve had all of these other ones that they&rsquo;ve brought out, there was the one that. Twitter brought out, I think it was called, I think it was called Taylor. Actually, and that within two hours it had started swearing and going through all of this.
Craig
Yeah. I think it was Microsoft&rsquo;s.
Taylor
Yeah, yeah, something like that, yeah.
Craig
Tay, I like how you&rsquo;ve identified with.
Taylor
It. Yeah, I know, because it was in the news. I was like, oh, God, another reason.
Craig
Yeah, yeah. And they basically, yeah, I think it was the the early experiment Microsoft did with AI or language learning models, right? It&rsquo;s not really AI.
Speaker 5
Yeah.
Craig
And then they they put it into the wild, and a lot of people were able similar to this be able to basically groom the AI to become a a foul racist. And the thing was, I guess it was how quickly the corrupting began of that, that AI model.
Speaker
Hmm.
Taylor
But again, it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s just a programme, just put in some things in place to stop it ever getting to that point.
Craig
And it is a sad reflection on humanity in terms of our desire to troll and to corrupt. And.
Taylor
But at the same time, like as a teacher. If you tell a student not to throw something, then all they wanna do is just throw throw it across.
Craig
The room. Maybe this is again another case of this is a reasonably safe space for that type of corruption to occur, right? And it&rsquo;s interesting listening to that clip as well. Part of the fun. Of doing it was, as we heard in the reaction. Oh my God, I don&rsquo;t believe I got defeated to say that it it is fun. I mean, the the appeal of the taboo, the. Appeal of saying naughty words.
Taylor
Or the naboo.
Craig
The Naboo saying the words you&rsquo;re not meant to do, and there&rsquo;s an appeal to that, I mean, I mean a. Lot of. It&rsquo;s there. Well, yeah. I I&rsquo;m thinking of a lot of humour. Is scatological a lot of humour is based on using to to do. I mean, I&rsquo;m not talking about the the racist stuff, it&rsquo;s more the. Kind of like getting into, say, the F. Weird.
Taylor
But can you really glean that much humour from?
Craig
Well, in a way, I mean, I guess, OK, an oppositional reading, right? So dominant reading would be ohh, this is really inappropriate and how bad on these people to exploit the system. A good one is it&rsquo;s also kind of, you know. Mystifying the scariness of a villain character, right, that you can just kind of hack into the system and get this character that&rsquo;s meant to be kind of like, Oh my God, I believe I&rsquo;m battling against Darth Vader and instead you&rsquo;re lampooning him and turning him into a clown, right, that you&rsquo;re kind of.
Taylor
I suppose, yeah.
Craig
Demasculinization your kind of. Removing all of the villainy of this Darth Vader character and instead he&rsquo;s yeah, you&rsquo;re revealing that it&rsquo;s just a bot and the bots dumb and the bot doesn&rsquo;t know what to do. And so you can just get the bot to do something stupid and out of character. And I think that&rsquo;s kind of creative.
Speaker
Hmm.
Craig
As well, I think had this is these aspects to this that are actually clever, right? I mean, figuring out that I mean and obviously you know within parameters you know clever in the initial thing you have this huge company spending all this money and taking all this care and usually there&rsquo;s a huge risk averseness. To you know, carefully making sure all of these are calibrated for the market and they&rsquo;re going to achieve X. Number of dollars. And it&rsquo;s going to be great. And then when it&rsquo;s just an epic fail because of some problem, the scrambling to fix it, you know, how bad can it get? Some of that is is is absurdly comical.
Taylor
Back on OK.
Craig
All right, so next next article? Yeah, another. Classically absurd things. So this is Mr Beast. Mr beast. So he&rsquo;s a incredibly toxic, toxic but very famous and wealthy. YouTube, Mr Beast YouTuber James Donaldson denies wrongdoing over the Mayan ruins video.
Taylor
Oh, that&rsquo;s right.
Craig
Yeah. So it&rsquo;s some YouTube thing is doing and they got access to them. Yeah, that&rsquo;s right. Yeah. They got access to the main pyramids ads. You know, they&rsquo;ve denied any wrongdoing. But after that footage became public, this was that.
Speaker 5
With that.
Taylor
Well, he did. He got the steps or something like that. You&rsquo;re not. Supposed to do that anymore? Yeah.
Craig
Oh, do you know how to pronounce it? Chichen itza. OK. The Mayan ruins in the Yucatan Peninsula, which is considered one of the seven.
Taylor
Yeah. Teaching it so.
Craig
Wonders of the world. Legally, visitors are. Welcome to come to the site, but they&rsquo;re banned from climbing the pyramids or visiting it after nightfall. They appear to have done both, certainly after nightfall, because you know, part of.
Speaker
For the.
Craig
The video is that he says nobody gets to go where we&rsquo;re going. And then he goes there, which suggests that.
Taylor
Paid off the government, probably.
Craig
Yeah, well, this is the I guess this is what this maybe is exposing. So yeah, again it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s an interesting. Again, another one of these epic fails of I guess you know so much money. Just put into this, they would have. They would have to have known this would cause some fallout. I guess they thought either they&rsquo;d they&rsquo;d been able to pay off everyone who needs to get. Paid off and have.
Taylor
Yeah, they thought their star power could carry them. Yeah.
Craig
Well, maybe they just like the publicity, right? I mean.
Taylor
Any publicity is good publicity.
Craig
Yeah, this, this, this, this certainly is brought it to my attention and media motherships, listeners and it was on the ABC News. All right, last story last style story Star Wars Darth Jar Jar. Now available in Fortnite, but fans can&rsquo;t believe you must earn 1,000,000 XP before you can buy him, so it&rsquo;s one of these. Kind of, yeah. And the subtitle Empire Strikes bank. And it&rsquo;s just, I mean, again, it&rsquo;s moral economy question at the other end of that Darth Vader problem, where the fans get to, you know, kind of rewire Darth Vader to show the absurdity of the AI system underpinning it, or the language learning model and defending it. This one is the greed side of it, where the Darth Jar jar. Is a fan favourite character in terms of its bit of fan fiction with Jar Jar Binks the most ridiculed character in the Star Wars pantheon. Fan theory saying that actually he was the mastermind evil villain behind everything as a Sith Lord, so they they&rsquo;d buy into this with Fortnite setting up a nice novel little idea that you can play as the dark version of this, but you have to grind for it. And it&rsquo;s an absurd grind and it&rsquo;s punishing. And it&rsquo;s interesting at what point fans playing a free game. Push back against that mechanic and say no more.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
Really. This is greed. This is exploitative. This is taking something, you know fans want and forcing them to to to buy it at a preposterous price. You know that that price label or that time. Cost linked to it. Value is broken from the fans point of view that you know they&rsquo;re they know this is something fans who. They&rsquo;re charging an extraordinary price. You&rsquo;re getting so upset. Thinking about it. Yeah, that there&rsquo;s an unfairness to it. Right. But I mean, again, how? How effective their complaints can be. You know, who knows?
Taylor
Well, that just reminds me of when it comes to unfairness, greed and corporate iness we&rsquo;ve got the new Switch 2 coming out. In is it 7 days or something like that? It&rsquo;s on June 5th I think.
Speaker 1
And.
Taylor
Mario Kart world, priced at $130.00 or $120.00 or something like that, and it looks like that&rsquo;s going to be the new normal for switch games, and probably PS2, PS, PS2, PS 5 and Xbox Games.
Craig
Yeah. Yes, there was another game where the game developers. That I think it&rsquo;s the latest. Yeah, it&rsquo;s the latest Borderlands game, Borderlands 4. The CEO has said. Because people are baulking at the price of it saying I feel they&rsquo;re listed at 4, but the CEO in response to the $80 being charged for this game is is response was. If you&rsquo;re a real fan, you&rsquo;ll find a way right. Which again, is this moral economy moment, right? What do you do when you get that, let them eat cake moment. From the privileged power holder, right French Revolution. Style that that moral outrage of saying, you know, you just don&rsquo;t get what it&rsquo;s like in the cost of living today, that this $80 charge isn&rsquo;t isn&rsquo;t what this rich person&rsquo;s imagining is, right. If you&rsquo;re a real fan, you&rsquo;ll find a way.
Taylor
No game should be above $100 is what I think.
Craig
Well, I guess this is within that $80.00, but yeah, it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s the response is, yeah, well yes, yes.
Taylor
$80 American.
Speaker 8
Yeah.
Craig
Yeah. So that, that&rsquo;s yeah that that&rsquo;s been considered quite tone deaf, alright.
Speaker
Hmm.
Craig
You&rsquo;re.
Taylor
Talking about tone deaf.
Craig
You&rsquo;re listening to its radio 9.3 FM. Stay clear of the platform. Let&rsquo;s move to the main topic of today, villains, villains. Yep. So as I mentioned last week.
Taylor
Medusa.
Craig
Medusa. Yeah. Yeah. Ursula, you can you can flip those interesting female villains. I mean, I think female villains are alright anyway. Well, they.
Taylor
Jaffa.
Craig
Let&rsquo;s pick it up from where we were last listening, just Disney. So what I want to go into now was a actually it was a Reddit post I came across. There&rsquo;s an interesting Reddit post a few days ago which has its tidal. The question there&rsquo;s moments in a movie where the the Pure Evil 1 dimensional villain gives a speech that recontextualizes them in the most terrifying way imaginable. OK, so it&rsquo;s a speech. Well, I&rsquo;ll play a couple of clips.
Taylor
I can&rsquo;t think of any. The top of my head. Now phanos.
Craig
Yeah, tennis is a great example. Any particular scene from Thanos in particular you think?
Taylor
Yeah. Ohh, where he&rsquo;s talking about bringing balance back, that&rsquo;s what. That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m. Thinking of yes.
Speaker
Yeah.
Craig
Yeah, it&rsquo;s great. See, I&rsquo;ll play clip. OK. Play. Play clip right. Here we go for the perfect balance. So we&rsquo;ll try it. 13 seconds. OK.
Speaker 9
Look. Pretty isn&rsquo;t it? Perfectly balanced, as all things should be.
Craig
All right. So that&rsquo;s the same way he meets Kimo.
Taylor
Ohh that&rsquo;s we&rsquo;ve got the the yeah, the knife.
Craig
Yeah, and and he is. I mean, it&rsquo;s not. I mean it&rsquo;s not necessarily it is recontextualizing them because in that scene we see a certain humanising quality to the villain. And an idea of their ideology.
Speaker
Oh.
Taylor
I&rsquo;m talking about the one where he talks about after he&rsquo;s done his famous snap. Yeah. And then he has the what&rsquo;s it called then? He&rsquo;ll look out upon a perfect world or something like that. Perfect human voice.
Craig
Maybe it&rsquo;s this one.
Speaker 9
OK, brilliant. You could not live with your own failure. Yeah. Where did that bring you? Back to me. You could not live. Where did that bring you?
Taylor
Just playing random bits from Infinity War now.
Speaker 9
To me.
Craig
How? How about Thanos&rsquo;s most powerful scene, OK.
Speaker 9
Congratulations, you&rsquo;re a prophet. On the survivor.
Speaker 1
Who wants to murder trillions?
Speaker 9
With all 6 stones, I could simply snap my fingers. They would all cease to exist. I call that. Mercy.
Speaker
And then what?
Speaker 9
Finally, rest and watch the sunrise in the Grateful Universe. The hardest choices require the strongest one.
Taylor
That&rsquo;s.
Speaker
Did you do it?
Speaker 9
Make it cost. Who wishes?
Craig
It is a. Great scene and that that scene where. He says, you know where. His kind of surrogate daughter up until that point, asks him, you know, what does it cost everything. Yeah, it is. It is a terrifying explanation of what the character is. So yeah, we want to go a little bit into that. The the Reddit post. Yeah. There&rsquo;s a couple of really interesting examples it gives.
Speaker
Hmm.
Craig
But let&rsquo;s first set the scene and have a look at maybe. I don&rsquo;t. Lure of the dark side. Evil characters we root for techniques for creating empathy. Techniques for creating empathy. I think that&rsquo;s the the the one we&rsquo;re looking at here. So jumping into this is the film courage clip techniques for creating empathy for your villainous character. OK. OK, here we go.
Speaker 8
What is the definition of an antihero? An anti hero is someone who becomes evil for sympathetic reasons. This is why we like him. This is Michael Corleone in the Godfather. This is Harvey Dent in in in Dark Knight. We have to have sympathetic reasons to like an antihero.
Speaker 4
There&rsquo;s a whole bunch of techniques and you can see what they. Do.
Craig
Alright, so sympathetic reasons to like a. Antihero. So some of the clips. I came across this one is from the new. UM, invincible. Cartoon series superhero series and then the last season in the last few episodes, they bring this new character. In called conquest. And conquest is this super powerful villain character. It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s, you know, we&rsquo;re talking about kind of evil Superman level and there&rsquo;s this fantastic monologue that Conquest gives, which is similar to this question of at the moment where a character is pure evil, he&rsquo;s demonstrated various evil acts. Of killing innocent people in very gory grizzly way. Is this villain? Who, up until this point with this monologue that we&rsquo;re about to hear, seems to just be pure evil? But then he delivers this monologue, which changes our view of them somewhat, right? Maybe a little more empathy towards that character. So as we heard in that clip, we sometimes want. To create that. Empathy. So let&rsquo;s listen to this one minute clip of Conquests&rsquo;s best monologue from the Invincible anime series. This is season 3.
Speaker 1
I am so lonely. All the other philtre minds are scared of me. No one talks to me. No one wants to be my friend. They think I am unstable. They send me from planet to planet, committing atrocities in their name. And as I get better at it. They fear me more and more. I am a victim of my own success conquest. I don&rsquo;t even get a real name. Only on purpose. I am capable of so much more, and no one sees it. Some days I feel so alone. I could cry, but I don&rsquo;t. I never do, because what would be the point?
Speaker 8
I&rsquo;m going.
Craig
To so that&rsquo;s. Dramatic scene of conquest, delivering this really unexpected monologue about his loneliness. He&rsquo;s so lonely. No one likes me. I have no friends, right? Everyone hates me so much that they&rsquo;ve given me the name conquest. Which is just a purpose. Right. And it&rsquo;s such a dramatic scene. The It&rsquo;s interesting reading the. The quotes some of the the comments underneath it, talking about how dramatic that scene is, if we jump back to the film writing guide just to see how that empathetic moment can work.
Speaker 4
To know what the techniques are. For me, it&rsquo;s like there&rsquo;s three, three things that you do that I that you do is is make us make us feel sorry for that character. So there&rsquo;s little moments where you can you can create a moment in the story where a character is unjustly abused or unjustly mistreated or insulted. Or. Betrayed or neglected. And so it it could be any character. And if that moment is there, you&rsquo;re gonna feel sorry for that character at that moment. Takes an instant. So that&rsquo;s one. If you show that they&rsquo;re like us, if you show their humanity, for example, you show that they care about something other than themselves. That&rsquo;s another technique.
Craig
So I felt. That that&rsquo;s kind of the technique there. They&rsquo;re not. They kind of like conquest. This, this viltrumite alien. Kind of villain character. He&rsquo;s like a he&rsquo;s he feels lonely. Right. He doesn&rsquo;t have any friends, like he&rsquo;s writing a diary entry. The a diary. I feel so lonely today. I have no friends anyway. It&rsquo;s just really, profoundly banal, everyday depressing existential model.
Speaker 10
Ohh my God.
Speaker 4
So there&rsquo;s a moment in the movie A Leon the professional, which is about a a, a hit man, right? And it opens with him doing a hit and he kills people you don&rsquo;t know if he&rsquo;s good or bad, but he goes home and he takes care of a plant. Right. And that right away, you say, oh, well, he cares about the plant, so he&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s OK. The other part is admiration. So this is like any. Any kind of you know, if you&rsquo;re dating somebody or you&rsquo;re trying to find somebody who was a good match for you, there&rsquo;s that list of list of things that you like in a person that&rsquo;s admirable trait. So somebody was funny. Who&rsquo;s responsible, who&rsquo;s courageous. That&rsquo;s a whole list of things you can add to a character to make us say, oh, well, you know, I admire this. Usually they&rsquo;re like, the best at what they do. They like the best. You know the best ad executive or the best agent or the best cop, or. The best driver? They&rsquo;re courageous. There&rsquo;s a whole bunch of them. I have hope. The list. The list is all in.
Craig
So there&rsquo;s three characteristics there. One of the ones that was mentioned in the Reddit list of Moments in where a villainous character delivers a monologue which makes you see them a bit differently, is the scene from the matrix with Agent Smith, right? So this is the scene where. Morpheus has been captured. Agent Smith has been interrogating him. And then in this. Moment he takes off his earpiece so he&rsquo;s no longer connected to the other kind of androids. And delivers this manogue monologue about his.
Taylor
Feelings manogue. Is that what a man?
Craig
Man alot. Gives. Well, here&rsquo;s what a manity gives. So let&rsquo;s. The.
Speaker 5
Going to be honest. With you. I. Hate this place? This. Zoo. Prison. This reality, whatever you want to call it, I can&rsquo;t stand it any longer. It&rsquo;s the smell. If there are such things. I feel saturated by it. They can taste your stink. You&rsquo;re time I do. I fear that I have somehow been infected by it. It&rsquo;s propulsive, isn&rsquo;t it? I must get out of here. I must get free. And in this mind is the key my key.
Speaker 1
I was happy.
Craig
Such a such an interesting scene there that then again, that. Idea of humanising the villain.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
Up until this point, we&rsquo;ve seen him as a kind of robot, kind of mechanical, villainous character, and then this, I must get free. I hate it here. I hate the smell. Very relatable.
Taylor
Mr. Anderson. Do you know who my favourite anti villain is? Yes, I don&rsquo;t. Have a guess.
Craig
Well, some of the the I guess some of the classic anti villains, you got dirty Harry.
Taylor
No. It&rsquo;ll be 1 you don&rsquo;t expect.
Craig
Maybe the first act of Star Wars where it&rsquo;s handsome.
Taylor
Because because they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re not an anti villain. Sorry, anti hero.
Craig
Anti hero. Yeah anti villain would be. I hear it. Yeah. You, you, you finally got around to watching the Godfather.
Taylor
No, no, no. Corleone. It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s an anti hero who is the main character.
Craig
Right, Harry Potter.
Taylor
Michael Douglas in falling down.
Craig
OK. Yeah. OK. Yeah, that&rsquo;s a yeah. So falling down, there&rsquo;s a note is the story of a kind of salary man in America. He loses his job, but then so embarrassed. Yeah. So embarrassed about the loss of his job that he can&rsquo;t tell his wife. And he&rsquo;s still going.
Taylor
Guys on the ranch.
Craig
I mean. You know, dressing up in his suit as if he still got his job and then he has one. Of these. Worst days possible.
Taylor
Yeah, he gets stuck in traffic.
Craig
Right and. It gets stuck in traffic, it gets bad service at a fast food restaurants, gets accosted by some some thugs, and he he just he just flips out and and does this weird wishful. So he&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s kind of villainous in terms of, you know, his. He he can&rsquo;t face up to the truth. He. He&rsquo;s lying. He then does extreme overreactions. Yeah, in these moments, but kind of like, you know, human overreactions, but ones which know, like, he gets a gun at some point, and he&rsquo;s shooting people. He gets a baseball bat at some point, and he&rsquo;s finally.
Taylor
Yeah.
Speaker 5
Yeah.
Craig
Bashing people, you know, it&rsquo;s just it&rsquo;s just disproportionate. Yeah. And also a sense of entitlement that that really these are not big problems. Yeah, that he&rsquo;s facing. But he&rsquo;s blowing them up. Yeah, it&rsquo;s a great role. What? What? Was it about that? You, you. You.
Taylor
Enjoyed. Ohh. It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s really like the movie and I&rsquo;d I&rsquo;d like that disproportionate response to it. And I was so sad when he got shot to death at the end. But.
Craig
Look, it is cause look tip. I mean, you could do a different version of. That movie where? He is redeemed right where it is that kind.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
Of which which? Is why I think the movie is so good that they don&rsquo;t concede that trope of, you know, because basically. You know, it&rsquo;s that kind of, you know what we&rsquo;re seeing today with Trump saying that, you know, Oh my God, the worst person. And the people in the world are these oppressed, alleged, you know, white genocide sufferers in South South Africa, right. It&rsquo;s this kind of, you know, the idea that that a, an identity which has been considered. The the patriarchal privileged norm white male in particular is somehow struggling and so not living a life. Which is meant to be the same, similar in falling down. It takes that hypocrisy or that sense of lack of of any sense of a realistic base of what real suffering might look like. Yeah. Yeah. No, that&rsquo;s. Yeah, that&rsquo;s a great choice. It&rsquo;s an underprivileged. Watched movie. I feel it is.
Taylor
Yes.
Craig
All right. So let&rsquo;s jump in. Where are we? What&rsquo;s the time? 2 minutes left. Alright. So we&rsquo;ll hear a little bit more about the guide. To writing evil characters.
Speaker 4
Book there&rsquo;s all these lists of things you can do, but if you do these three things, and so when I show clips of the of the moment you meet the character and it&rsquo;s usually like a 3 minute scene. You can see all these things being applied in like 3 minutes. There&rsquo;s like, you know, the the opening of WALL-E after he&rsquo;s done with the garbage and he comes to his to his little house. It&rsquo;s a 3 minute scene and it&rsquo;s about 20 of these techniques done. This is how you connect with that character in one scene emotionally. Also show a clip of a of A of an ad, a commercial. It&rsquo;s a one minute. Thing about a lamb.
Craig
So the next one I mean, is this really interesting scene from well, in a way. Yeah. Some people in the chat mentioned this scene in Star Wars as being one which which. Agendas. Humanising of the of the character.
Speaker 7
So you have accepted the truth.
Speaker 4
I&rsquo;ve accepted the truth.
Speaker 11
That you will, once Anakin Skywalker my father.
Speaker 7
That name no longer has any meaning for me.
Speaker 4
It is the name of your true self. You&rsquo;ve only.
Speaker 1
Forgotten? No, there is good.
Speaker 5
The Emperor hasn&rsquo;t driven it from you.
Speaker 9
For me to come.
Speaker 7
Hobby one, once thought as you do.
Speaker 5
I&rsquo;m sorry, Eric. For all.
Speaker 7
Of it, you don&rsquo;t know the power of the dark side. I must obey. I must.
Speaker 5
I will not turn.
Speaker
And you&rsquo;ll be forced.
Speaker 7
To kill if that is with destiny.
Speaker 8
You can&rsquo;t do this.
Speaker 11
I feel the conflict within you. Let go of. Your hate.
Speaker 7
We lose too late.
Speaker 1
My father is truly.
Craig
Different. Alright, so that&rsquo;s the same return of the Jedi defender Luke Skywalker. And again, those moments where Darkseid is delivering those lanes of, you know you don&rsquo;t know the power of the dark side. Not in terms of where you should join me in the dark side, but a true sense of the oppressiveness of that ideology is is under. And that final scene, you know. It&rsquo;s too late for me, son. Is quite alright. Well that. Last clip one, I think that you&rsquo;ll be. Able to respond. To sure. Again, here we have a classic scene. I want to tell you.
Taylor
Voldemort.
Craig
It&rsquo;s not that. One, it&rsquo;s the it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s Gollum. It&rsquo;s something I know you&rsquo;ve got a background in. It&rsquo;s a scene where one of the big villains in this series is delivering a kind of justification for their actions.
Taylor
Let&rsquo;s call.
Craig
Them right and. It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s not necessarily humanising or admiring them, but it is providing us with an insight into, OK, well, they&rsquo;re not just.
Taylor
MHM.
Craig
Doing villainy because yeah, they want to. It&rsquo;s for some other reason.
Speaker 10
Now future errors will be eradicated, defeats will become victories. You will have changed the future of the.
Craig
Universe. So of course this is Doctor Who facing off against. Ross. Yeah, in the classic Tom Baker series. So this is this great kind of face off between the two characters. I&rsquo;m just waiting until it gets to the scene that I want to.
Speaker 6
It&rsquo;s not the machines, it&rsquo;s the.
Craig
Unpack.
Taylor
This is genesis.
Craig
Of the dogs genesis. That&rsquo;s right. Yeah. Genesis Daleks consider one of probably the best episodes in Doctor Who&rsquo;s history. So there&rsquo;s a bit of intellectual sparring between what these Daleks represents.
Speaker 10
With the darlings of the supreme rulers of the universe there. You will have peace. Wars will end. They are the power, not of evil. But of God.
Speaker 6
Davros. If you had created a virus in your laboratory, something contagious and infectious that killed on contact a virus that would destroy all other forms of life. Would you allow its?
Speaker 10
Use. It is an interesting conjecture, only living thing.
Speaker 6
Would you do?
Speaker 4
It.
Speaker 10
The microscopic Organism.
Speaker 9
Reigning supreme.
Speaker 10
Fascinating idea.
Speaker 6
But would you do it?
Speaker 10
Yes.
Speaker 1
Yes.
Speaker 10
To hold in my hand a capsule that contained such power. To know that life and death on such a scale was my choice. To know that the tiny pressure on my son enough to break the glass would end. Everything.
Speaker 1
Yeah.
Speaker 10
I would do it.
Speaker 11
That power would sit me up above the gods and through the darlings. I shall have that power.
Craig
Well, great scene, great scenes. So again, you know, in terms of Dan Ross&rsquo;s villainy, you know, the Doctor asks that question. Of. You know Dave Ross, if in one of your experiments you created the virus accidentally that you discovered that virus could kill every living being, you know, would you decide to destroy that virus or not? And I guess it&rsquo;s a test there of because what&rsquo;s happening in this episode is the doctor is struggling with this. Decision of does he kill the Daleks or not? Like he said, the genesis of the Daleks highly suggest is is the inception point at which the Ducks begin. Doctor is afforded this opportunity to.
Taylor
Yes.
Craig
Wipe him out. To eradicate them at the moment of their. And so this question is kind of testing, is Davros really a bad game, right? Is there any remaining empathy or sense of, you know, if Davros answered, for instance, Gee, you know, yeah. Obviously, if I found that I&rsquo;d accidentally made this virus that kills everyone. Yeah, that&rsquo;s pretty horrible. I don&rsquo;t want to kill everyone. I just want to.
Taylor
I think that&rsquo;s also a turning point of where the Doctor realises that Davros would destroy if he could. And so therefore the right thing to do would be to not.
Craig
Destroy that, Davros ultimately is irredeemable in terms of even a hypothetical question. That&rsquo;s not about creating a master race. Garlic species that are going to bring peace to the world, right? So again, that was just before then, but, you know. Actually, the dogs aren&rsquo;t an instrument for evil. They like Thanos going to bring a sense of of balance and peace around us. We&rsquo;re going to wipe out every other, you know, kind of aggressive species.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
And be left with peace. And yes, the dialects will just happen to be at the top of that space, so again he shifts it by saying OK, we&rsquo;re not talking about dialects anymore, we&rsquo;re talking about a virus, a virus that would even kill every other person here. And even with that, we were revealed the idea that DeVos is wants power. He wants at least to be recognised. Eyes. Like a God at being able to decide who lives and dies. So a very Thanos type God complex in terms of you know that it it&rsquo;s nevertheless an attempt by the script writers to humanise that villain action. Right. Yeah. Why? Would someone want to do this? Why would someone want to create super soldiers?
Taylor
Daleks slash Nazis, which is what it was based on, yeah.
Craig
Yeah, yeah, yeah. And it&rsquo;s such a fantastic unpacking of that, that, that idea. And I guess, yeah. So Davos doesn&rsquo;t shift into being an anti villain. And to hear. The same thing. Anti hero? Yeah, because it&rsquo;s potentially a lot a a kind of sequence of thoughts that could change the character. Yeah, right. Where he goes. Yes, I see now, doctor, the error of my ways right. Clearly there should be cheques and balances. I don&rsquo;t just want to kill everyone, but there&rsquo;s like.
Taylor
No, no. Why yes, now I would use that power.
Craig
One few to decide who lives and dies to be a God. Yeah. So it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s. It&rsquo;s a nice scene. And again the the the rising of the voice. And of course, yeah. Then the doctor decides. You know, he&rsquo;s got to get Davros to kill the Daleks, right? You know, to wipe out Davros and the Daleks. Yeah. Think about that in terms of, if you&rsquo;re finding yourself facing off against a villain, yeah, you know, raising a villain. Is there a moment to humanise them, and does that? Help create a more engaging story if you haven&rsquo;t seen it, do watch falling down. Yeah worth watching and and yeah, that&rsquo;s me meeting mothership for another week. We&rsquo;ll dive into some more unpacking of media around us next week and. Before we sign off, any promotions for the new show, you&rsquo;re setting up Taylor, no?
Taylor
Not yet.
Craig
They&rsquo;re still Facebook, though. DM for Epley.
Taylor
There&rsquo;s still a Facebook at DM for Airplay, but it&rsquo;s not going to be for the next two weeks because I have exams next.
Craig
Week so. Ohh yeah. Wow. We, we you could do an exam themed music show. What music to listen to for exams?
Taylor
Songs to scratch out your eyes too.
Craig
Yeah, alright. Well, that&rsquo;s the media mothership for another week. Keep listening now to some really cool tunes on Edge radio. If you want to find out more about the email, so feel free to jump on the Facebook page for us or the Instagram page. Back episodes are also on YouTube.

And you can buy cracker coffee.
Craig
If you want coffee, it&rsquo;s not a not a cheap option these days, or you can go podcast you can you can search for us on on the podcast provider or.

<p>How to Write Villainous Characters.</p>



<p>Drawing on Film Courage&rsquo;s guide to creating evil characters, we explore the concept of &ldquo;The Conflict in Every Human Heart&rdquo; and the idea that &ldquo;every person has a breaking point.&rdquo; We will discuss this theme through key movies and TV characters, including Colonel Kurtz from <em>Apocalypse Now</em>, Michael Corleone from <em>The Godfather</em>, Harvey Dent from <em>Batman</em>, Walter White from <em>Breaking Bad</em>, and various characters from the <em>Harry Potter</em> universe.</p>

       Craig
Yes, you&rsquo;re listening to media mothership now. We&rsquo;re back. Yeah, I&rsquo;ve kind of got everything almost set up here in the studio. This is media mothership. As always, we explore how media can shape our understanding of the world around us. We&rsquo;re streaming on edgeradio.org dot AU as well as YouTube and Twitch. You can find us on YouTube and Twitch. Just search for media mothership. See us in the flesh. On the video. And during the show, if you have any thoughts of your own, feel free to send us a message on the chat. YouTube or Twitch chat or you can SMS us directly in the studio on 0488811707 so. So as I mentioned, we&rsquo;re going to be exploring the idea of writing villains, writing evil villainous characters, seeing how those villainous characters from movies and television can be crafted so well, I&rsquo;ve been enjoying the final episodes. Of the Star Wars series and or, and really relishing the juxtaposition that TV series has between the. The. Evil characters from the empire and the kind of morally ambiguous, I guess at times good characters, and there&rsquo;s quite a lot of kind of comparison between the two characters or the various characters in the in the. In the show that has got me thinking about villains, how best to portray and set up villains. So we&rsquo;re going to start with a discussion from film Courage, the film Courage YouTube site. It&rsquo;s an interesting YouTube site, goes over various.
Speaker 5
Then the sirens get louder.
Craig
This tips and advice for film writing and creating films as well as if you&rsquo;re enjoying films. Some of the analysis of, in this case a guide to writing evil characters. We&rsquo;ll we&rsquo;ll listen to the first set up for it, and then we&rsquo;ll deep dive into some characters I think. Presents similar motifs of effective evil characters and and not so we&rsquo;ll we&rsquo;ll hear the intro. The entry sets up this really interesting character, which we may or may not consider at the point at which we&rsquo;re meeting them is evil. The the character of war. The white from Breaking Bad. So let&rsquo;s first hear this introduction to I think this is the first episode of Breaking Bad where Walter White&rsquo;s character is again at the precipice of. Becoming an evil character.
Speaker 5
Walter takes a gun from his underwear, steps up to the road, points the pistol right at the at the road, and stands there while the siren gets loud and if cold open. That&rsquo;s a great cliffhanger and it&rsquo;s a ticking clock and it doesn&rsquo;t get resolved. And we go to the credits.
Speaker 6
There&rsquo;s a wonderful speech in Apocalypse now, which is based on heart of darkness, Joseph Conrad&rsquo;s novel. And when Martin Sheen is getting his mission to go kill Marlon Brando, Colonel Kurtz, the general who&rsquo;s giving him the mission, says the theme of the story, which is. There is a conflict in every human heart between the light and the dark, between good and evil, and the light does not always win. Sometimes the darkness overcomes what Lincoln called the better angels of our nature. Every man has got a breaking point.
Craig
So that was the script writer Pamela J Smith talking about a scene from the Francis Ford Coppola War movie Apocalypse now, set during the Vietnam War and the really fascinating character of. Portraying Kurt. So this is in act one of Apocalypse now as our protagonist, Captain Willard, played by Martin Sheen, is being sat down by his kind of CIA mind. And his character describing to him this descent of a previously considered heroic character played by Marlon Brando, who seems to have. Become ill. Let&rsquo;s actually listen to that scene from the movie to set in this idea of again how to write a a villain character, an evil character. And the idea here that that Pamela J Smith is presenting is that you you want to be able to have. A breaking point. Where this character or one way of developing the villain character is the breaking point moment where the character. Has is, is. Is broken and becomes evil literally in the scene we just heard there described was Walter White from Breaking Bad. Literally the breaking point for a character to break bad. So here we&rsquo;ll hear from Apocalypse now. That Breaking Bad moment.
Speaker 7
I&rsquo;m good. And you? Does not always triumph sometimes. The dark side overcomes what Lincoln called the better angels of our nature.
Speaker 8
These fools found.
Speaker 7
Every man has got a breaking point. You and I have.
Speaker 9
Ohh Lord.
Craig
Interestingly, this idea of breaking points if you search on YouTube for movies with breaking Point moments, a movie that comes up quite. A bit is the. Shawshank Redemption, and again a character refers to breaking points within. Shawshank redemption. So the symbol we&rsquo;ll hear from now is. Kind of in the third act of the film, where a characters using this phrase, every man has his breaking point. So in the short Shank redemption the we&rsquo;re going to see here is. Is this moment where an individual, even the strongest individual, will reach this moment of of, of despair or hopelessness? Right. So in in, in Apocalypse now for Colonel Kurtz&rsquo;s character. The idea they&rsquo;re trying to grasp get their heads around is is clearly this character has arrived at this breaking point moment. And despair. Hopelessness has driven them over the edge. In this case, in Shawshank Redemption, it&rsquo;s interesting what that sets up. You know, it&rsquo;s not setting up a villain turn a heel turn if we&rsquo;re to use the wrestling parlance, it&rsquo;s not a a movement that&rsquo;s breaking the character of Andy. But nevertheless, we&rsquo;ll hear how this scene gets conveyed with the breaking point moment.
Speaker 9
Ohh Lord.
Speaker 8
What?
Speaker 9
Andy, come down to loading dock today. He asked me for a length of rope bro 6 feet long. You gave it.
Speaker 6
Oh God.
Speaker 7
Remember Brooks hatlen? No.
Speaker 8
And you&rsquo;d never do that.
Speaker 10
Every man has his breaking point.
Speaker 11
Man missing on Tier 2 cell 245 New Friday. Get your *** out here, boy. You hold up the show. Don&rsquo;t make me come down there. I&rsquo;ll thump your skull for you. Damn it, dude friend, you&rsquo;re putting me behind. I gotta schedule the cake. You better be sick or dead in there. I sick you not, you hear me? Ohh my holy God.
Speaker 2
Michael corleones.
Craig
So it&rsquo;s an interesting moment there as we can hear from that scene in the third act, wear red and the other inmates. Are. Are beginning to fear that Andy may. Have lost hope. And that moment that Morgan Freeman&rsquo;s character reads, referring to the breaking point. Moment is that.
Speaker 1
You know.
Craig
Has has Andy lost hope instead actually here that breaking point dialogue is a misdirection to the audience, whereas rather than a moment of of kind of turning to hopelessness and despair, it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s actually overcoming. That&rsquo;s the resilience of the character after that scene. As we just heard a little bit of a teaser there. If we think about that idea, though, and jumping back to the writing guide of Breaking Point Moments. It&rsquo;s interesting to consider those moments where a character. Does have the the character arc is about exploring a breaking point, so one of the best examples of this would be the Godfather and the character of Michael Corleone. Who begins the film initially as a hero? Literally. World War 2 Soldier considered heroic in that first act. He&rsquo;s on a pathway to to marry. He&rsquo;s not part of his family business, which turns out to be part of the Mafia, and he doesn&rsquo;t want anything to do with that. Criminal empire and during the course of the movie, it&rsquo;s fascinating to see as he reaches a breaking point as he turn, he breaks. Bad he becomes an evil character, or at least a morally compromised character by the end, and this transformation, I guess from from a a heroic character into a ruthless mafia boss represents. For many people, a a fantastic Breaking Bad exploration, let&rsquo;s listen to a couple of clips. What I&rsquo;ve created here are some really interesting clips. From a series of YouTube shorts. Where various YouTube movie analysis channels have created short little 1020 second clips of character exploration. The reason why I&rsquo;m doing these YouTube shorts. And they&rsquo;re very AI based in terms of, you know, you can hear that distinctly AI voice that&rsquo;s coming in is that I think it&rsquo;s really setting up, you know, the dominant way of reading these characters if. We understand audience meaning making through Stuart Hall&rsquo;s reception theory. You can see it having 3 aspects, 1 the kind of dominant reading which is the reading the mainstream reading, the reading that you know the the director intended you to get. Is the reading that the audience is kind of matching up to, so a lot of these YouTube shorts are pretty much going to be the dominant reading a lot of AI searches you do will give you more often than not a dominant reading in terms of they&rsquo;ll be looking for something, particularly if the search is not asking for. Or a resistant or a positional reading. It will just give you what it&rsquo;s been able to dredge through from mainstream sources, often trying to avoid a kind of overt controversial position. You know it will take a neutral tone often the AI. Certs so these little AI clips I&rsquo;ll play from various YouTube channels. Exploring character identification are fascinating because of the way to set up a dominant reading. Of the Breaking Bad idea for a character development. There is, of course, as Stuart Hall argues, always negotiated and oppositional readings that audiences can play around with. So it&rsquo;ll be interesting to see whether or not those Breaking Bad ideas that some of these channels suggest are at the core of those characters are not there at all. Or maybe there&rsquo;s a negotiated reading partially in that. Camp but also saying this character also is sympathetic in. Of. You know the Michael Quarry Leone character is a great one in terms of, yes, well, you could say he breaks bad to become an evil mafia kingpin. You could also say, you know, there&rsquo;s a lot of family loyalty and and survival, the ability to survive there, which is a kind of negotiated reading of that character, is not completely morally. Bankrupt and evil, he has good aspects. You know, a survival instinct, a a strong loyalty to family. Or an oppositional reading. But. Let&rsquo;s read. Let&rsquo;s listen to. This Michael Corleone transformation, Part 1 YouTube short from the Channel character chronicles.
Speaker 2
Reluctance to join the family business reveals his inner conflict. See the moment he questions his path.
Speaker 12
When when Johnny was first starting out, he was signed to this personal service contract. Now Johnny is my father&rsquo;s. And my father went to see this band and he offered him $10,000 to let Johnny go. But the band leader said no. The next day, my father went to see him, only this time with Luca Brizzy. And within an hour he signed a release or a certified check of $1000.
Speaker 6
Why do you do that?
Speaker 12
Luca Brazzi held a gun to his head and my father assured him that either his brains or his signature would be. On the contract. That&rsquo;s my family cake. It&rsquo;s not me.
Speaker 13
1.
Craig
See, that&rsquo;s my family key. Not me. Again, act one. Heroic character of Michael Polyone. Played by Al Pacino, the idea that he&rsquo;s actually a a heroic character, not Breaking Bad. That&rsquo;s his family, his family&rsquo;s mafia, right. They&rsquo;ll they&rsquo;ll send a heavy in to threaten the death of of of this poor guy so that they get what they want. So instead here we have this moment of the character transitioning into something else. So let&rsquo;s have a look another YouTube short from the cinema craft here again, unpacking those pivotal scenes which made Michael Corleone. Great. Bad.
Speaker 10
These moments showcase Michael&rsquo;s transformation from reluctant outsider to ruthless Mafia leader shaping the film&rsquo;s tragic arc. Michael introduces Kate to his family but insists he&rsquo;s different.
Speaker 12
That&rsquo;s my family, Kate. It&rsquo;s not me.
Speaker 10
Distancing himself from the mob life. When his father is nearly killed, Michael realises the family&rsquo;s vulnerability, starting his pull into the business.
Speaker 12
I&rsquo;m with you now.
Speaker 10
Michael kills Sollozzo and McCluskey making his first violent move and committing to the family&rsquo;s way in hiding Michael Mary&rsquo;s Appolonia.
Speaker 11
No, no.
Speaker 10
Her murder hardens him and pushes him further into the criminal world. Vito&rsquo;s passing cements Michael is the head of the Corleone family, stepping into his father&rsquo;s shoes. Michael orders the elimination of all rivals during his godson&rsquo;s baptism, sealing his fate as the ruthless godfather.
Speaker 12
Make him an offer you can&rsquo;t refuse.
Speaker 1
Here&rsquo;s a TV.
Craig
So there&rsquo;s a number of steps there that that example of the pivotal scenes that made Michael Corleone evil or the Mafia king around that idea of of a breaking point and the first one, the one. The the death of his his father. And his sense of being brought into the family through killing the corrupt police officer is that that, you know, first kind of breaking point idea of. His, his, his gradually getting pulled into the Mafia so that as we heard in those other clips his he&rsquo;s making offers that the other character cannot refuse. Let&rsquo;s get back to film Courage now and hear some other tips on how to write. An evil character.
Speaker 5
Then the sirens get louder. Walter takes a.
Speaker 6
It&rsquo;s novel, stubborn.
Speaker 14
This came from Cliff Osman. Was my acting coach and he said. He said he had never seen a decent portrayal of Hitler. Because. The the person so vilified by society that no actor had ever played him from a true place. He was always a villain and he said, you know, who didn&rsquo;t think Hitler was a. Hitler. Hitler didn&rsquo;t think he was. A villain at all. Hitler thought he was doing amazing things for this race of people, and he said because of that, you don&rsquo;t get a real, honest portrayal, he said. You cannot. Judge. Your character. In fact, you have to think of yourself as. Your character&rsquo;s attorney. Ohh wow, you have to plead your case. Or the case of the character to the audience. You can&rsquo;t do that if you&rsquo;re judging the character. And I took that with acting. And I also took that into my writing as well. You know, everybody is coming from a place where they think they&rsquo;re doing the right thing.
Speaker 6
Why?
Speaker 14
You know, so. That&rsquo;s. I think that&rsquo;s really important actually when you&rsquo;re developing. Characters. There&rsquo;s a minute you judge character. You&rsquo;ve got a 2 dimensional. Character. You know you&rsquo;ve got a flat. You know, it&rsquo;s like, OK, I know this guy&rsquo;s story. He&rsquo;s the bad guy or he&rsquo;s the good guy.
Speaker 6
Whatever it is, even good characters do bad things and I think.
Speaker 14
Right. And that&rsquo;s the thing, it&rsquo;s that the complexity of life, you know, no one&rsquo;s.
Speaker 3
They&rsquo;re justified for you.
Speaker 14
All bad or all good.
Speaker 10
In order to create a.
Craig
All right. So we&rsquo;ll pick up some ideas there by the actor and script writer Marcus Redmond, particularly his point of when you&rsquo;re writing a villain. Think of yourself as a character&rsquo;s attorney, which is a, you know, a really fascinating way to avoid that mistake. Of just doing A2 dimensional cardboard, cut out villain and instead. Recognise as Marcus Redman says. There&rsquo;s no good versions of Hitler because everyone sees him as A2 dimensional character rather than not let&rsquo;s have a look at the idea of Walter White and the change. He goes through.
Speaker 1
So here&rsquo;s a TV character moment that I think was just brilliant writing. When Walter White gets diagnosed with cancer, he worries over financing his treatment and supporting his family. But when a wealthy friend, having heard the news, offers him a good job, seemingly so. On a plate to save he so desperately needs, Walt just stares back at him, insulted by the very idea that he needs someone&rsquo;s help. So Walt dives into a life of crime, becoming a multimillionaire on a foundation of sin to prove that he is capable until years later, his enemies catch him, beat him, rob him, and leave him for nothing. So defeated Walt calls to turn himself in until he turns on the TV. And sees that same friend giving an interview talking about how little he regards Walter White. And suddenly despite a lifetime having passed, the grizzled Walt is pulled back to. The moment seething at the idea of being looked down on so he gets up, evades the troopers and sets out to correct him. And with just that moment, the show makes overwhelmingly clear that after five seasons of triumphs and losses, that could have helped anyone grow, Walter White remains now, as he has been from the beginning and impressively intelligent man with the fragile ego of a child.
Speaker 3
The explosion kills Rachel, which?
Craig
That was that was the example of of Walter White. There again, a great character in terms of breaking in, breaking a breaking point character where his breaking point as that argument from the reliable narrator channel. Argues. That actually, Walter White&rsquo;s character is breaks bad because. His ego is. So fragile that he he cannot allow his, you know, ego not to be seen as brilliant, which means throughout. And it&rsquo;s an interesting Breaking Bad. Have you seen Breaking Bad?
Taylor
I I haven&rsquo;t seen anything to do with breaking.
Craig
Bad. Well, there&rsquo;s a great moment in this series, right? Characters, very sympathetic at the start. Of course, the character Walter White diagnosed with cancer, decides that he is.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
All of his earnings are not sufficient to take care of his family, but then through a a school student he&rsquo;d taught realises there&rsquo;s a lot of money to be made in drugs, so it&rsquo;s it kind of is going to pursue that pathway. But then a a rich friend of his.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
Who finds out that he&rsquo;s got cancer, says well, why don&rsquo;t you come and work with me? You know, you you won&rsquo;t be asked to do too much, but I can provide for you and make sure your. We set up and his sense of crushed ego just being getting a handout was so significant that that he, that&rsquo;s one breaking point. He reaches right where he decides. No, screw you. I&rsquo;m don&rsquo;t need your hand out. I&rsquo;m better than you.
Taylor
I wanna make a. Legal drug I&rsquo;m gonna make.
Craig
And then throughout, as this channel saying, he increasingly he makes the it&rsquo;s not a a kind of 1 breaking point and then becomes evil. It&rsquo;s a series of breaking points through which he makes morally ambiguous, bad bad behaviours. My co-host Taylor&rsquo;s joined. Hey. Hey. So now one of the other things. And while you&rsquo;re here, actually, we may as well jump into one of the other parts, which is. Good characters sometimes make bad decisions, right? So there&rsquo;s a number of points with it. Marcus Redmond, the script writer there is talking about moments when. Where you know you want to write complicated characters, you want to advocate for your character and be their attorney. And there are moments also where good characters do bad things, right? It&rsquo;s not black and white. You don&rsquo;t want to do just a black and white character. I I got a YouTube short here from the Harry Potter central because I know these are. Films you have seen the characters you do.
Taylor
I know this. Yeah. OK.
Craig
OK, so this is 1/5 of the worst things done by good characters.
Taylor
In Harry Potter.
Craig
In Harry.
Taylor
OK, we&rsquo;ll do.
Craig
Is we&rsquo;ll listen to some of these and we&rsquo;ll discuss whether indeed, these these are kind of breaking point moments, right? These are these are these are moments where. Yeah.
Taylor
Dumbledore. Stumbled or should be #1. You raised Harry Potter like a pig for slaughter.
Speaker 16
Five of the worst things done by good characters #1 Jenny ended up opening up the Chamber of Secrets by complete accident, and Tom used her for her whole first.
Craig
Year at Hogwarts, Jenny opened up.
Taylor
The Chamber of Secrets.
Craig
Chamber of Secrets. What was her motivation for doing?
Taylor
That she was being possessed. That&rsquo;s not.
Speaker
Oh.
Taylor
Really a motivation?
Craig
So her character her.
Taylor
Kaden did something bad, but she was.
Craig
A bad thing? Did a.
Taylor
In control.
Craig
Of it right, it&rsquo;s that that&rsquo;s pretty excusable.
Taylor
Apart, apart from, apart from the fact of that she was talking to Tom Riddle in a book. And shouldn&rsquo;t have been.
Craig
Doing that and there were weaknesses in her character, right? So there were flaws. There was like loneliness or craving. Male attention. Yeah, that that then caused her to make a bad decision. Yeah. It wasn&rsquo;t a Breaking Bad point, right? She didn&rsquo;t become an evil character after.
Taylor
Yeah, yeah.
Craig
That was she.
Taylor
I really do like. I really do like the sort of like the undertones of ginnies talking to the the book though, it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s.
Craig
Because Tom Riddle.
Taylor
It&rsquo;s. Because it&rsquo;s talking in, in, in terms of, like, it&rsquo;s an obvious connection. Between spilling your secrets onto the Internet. That&rsquo;s what rights.
Craig
Yep, a strong, strong metaphor of that. Yeah, yeah. Alright. Well, it&rsquo;s just number two of the, you know, worst things a good character does from Harry.
Speaker
Yeah.
Speaker 16
Potter #2 double doors love for Grindelwald wasn&rsquo;t the bad decision, but that doesn&rsquo;t change the fact that Grindelwald ended up being who he was. #3 I want.
Craig
Alright, hold on.
Taylor
Well, I I couldn&rsquo;t get my brain around that was.
Speaker 17
So.
Craig
Great. What&rsquo;s the character? What&rsquo;s the connection between Grindelwald and Dumbledore? This is fantastic piece, right?
Taylor
I I will be honest, I haven&rsquo;t. Really paid attention to Fantastic Beasts and I haven&rsquo;t even seen the last one of fantastic beasts I didn&rsquo;t like.
Craig
All right, let&rsquo;s. Yeah, that&rsquo;s fine, that&rsquo;s. Fine. All right.
Taylor
The thirsty so much.
Speaker 16
#3 he was #3 all dobbies attempts at saving Harry Potter and Chamber of Secrets were all actually pretty bad decisions, including jinxing them. Number. All right, all right.
Taylor
Who&rsquo;s Dobby, who&rsquo;s dobby?
Craig
Dobby, obviously the one and only they&rsquo;re my favourite character from the whole series.
Taylor
Really.
Craig
He&rsquo;s such a he&rsquo;s. Like JoJo binks? Right. He&rsquo;s like, you know, and that&rsquo;s and JoJo. Binks is an interesting Breaking Bad character. Because JoJo Big&rsquo;s character was so irredeemable in terms of. You know, a kind of childish character that. Kind of devalued the entirety of the Phantom Menace series that fans then said this card would be much more interesting if in. Fact he was a dog was a tough.
Speaker 16
He.
Craig
Yeah, a sith. A Sith character, right said that.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
Yeah, he, he. Broke bad. So many fans say that that, yeah, John, John Banks was. The ultimate puppet Master Sith character that was Breaking Bad through. Dobby does does Dobby make bad decisions?
Taylor
Oh, absolutely.
Craig
And are those breaking point decisions right? Those are those are bad decisions which which cause.
Taylor
Them to go to the dark side. Yeah, no.
Craig
No. OK, well, but what his his decisions do have ramifications. He does die. Thank goodness. Spoiler alert.
Taylor
Something you never managed to do.
Craig
But again, yeah, good characters can do bad things, but in this case dobbies bad things were all you know, how would you characterise the bad things?
Taylor
It was still under like, because he had to hide it from the Malfoy family, who owned him, right? Yeah. And so he had to do it in these sort of surreptitious sort of dangerous ways instead of actually actually coming out and going. Fixed, sorry, fixed fixed.
Craig
Haggard. Alright. Haggard&rsquo;s you know. Let&rsquo;s see what the.
Speaker 16
Grid having Harry and Ron find Aragog might have helped clear his name with them, but they almost ended up getting eaten in.
Craig
The process. So what&rsquo;s the story with Aragog again?
Taylor
Yeah. Follow the spiders. Follow the spiders. No, that&rsquo;s Fang.
Craig
Said the big dog.
Speaker 18
OK, right.
Taylor
Which followed the spiders into the the Forbidden Forest, not the Black Forest that&rsquo;s in Germany, into the Forbidden Forest. And at the end there&rsquo;s a massive spider who tries to feed him, feed them to.
Craig
So.
Taylor
The family. That&rsquo;s why the family.
Craig
Good characters do bad things. In this case. Hagrid, who is you know, kind of a mentor, a kind of custodian to the boys, right? He&rsquo;s.
Taylor
Yeah, yeah.
Craig
The the 1st. Wizarding character the Harry needs really and he&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s he. He very much means well. What was he screw up here? Now is the bad thing.
Taylor
Well, cause he was just about to go to Azkaban right? And and so he needed people to basically know that it wasn&rsquo;t him who had the the creature that was killing everyone, IE the basilisk.
Speaker
Right.
Taylor
And so he sent Harry and Ron into the forest. To me, almost certain peril. Young kind.
Speaker
Cheap.
Craig
Of you know.
Taylor
15 year old.
Craig
50 year old school student.
Taylor
Oh no 12 year olds.
Craig
Yeah, into into a known dangerous place. Yeah, yeah.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
There are no repercussions. Did he lose his joy or he lost?
Taylor
His not really.
Craig
OK. Last one number.
Speaker 16
#5 Harry almost ended up killing Draco Malfoy with Sectumsempra, and luckily Snape was there to.
Speaker
OK.
Speaker 16
Reverse the effects.
Craig
All right, so. So. Harry&rsquo;s bad decisions. Yeah, right.
Taylor
He&rsquo;s reading the half blood Princess potion book and scribbled into the side pages is an unknown spell and it is and it says 4 enemies and so he just decides to use it on Draco Malfoy, his in enemy and always kills.
Craig
Him. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And that the only reason, Malfoy. Lived was because Snape was there.
Taylor
To yeah. To reverse the facts because he invented that.
Craig
Spell. Really. Mind blown. So again, potentially yes, that could have been a breaking point for Harry, right? Actually killing so many people point out that&rsquo;s a that&rsquo;s a moment where a hero often does turn to a more morally complicated or compromised character where the.
Taylor
I mean that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s another thing with the half blood Prince. Like if you watch the movie you have snake there going and he goes I am the half blood Prince and it&rsquo;s like yeah sure. What So what how how are you the half blood Prince and gets rid of all of this entire back story with the back. He is. He&rsquo;s a half blood and his muggle mother, her last name was Prince. And so therefore he was 1/2 blood.
Craig
Alright. Prince, I mean, I mean, snitch character is interesting in terms of a a villain, right? I mean, he very much comes across as the villain. A what? What was the breaking point? Sneep right. It was his left triangle, wasn&rsquo;t it? Between Harry&rsquo;s parents?
Taylor
But that&rsquo;s the point. Snape was never banned.
Craig
And sneads it. Wow. So the reveal comes, but nevertheless, the reason why he&rsquo;s not.
Taylor
But snipe, snipe snipe started off as a bad character. Mm-hmm. And the breaking point to him turning good was the love triangle with his mother, with, not with his mother without his mother.
Craig
Yeah. OK. Yeah, that&rsquo;s interesting, right. So. With his mother. Yeah. Yeah. So in ways, yes. Snape broke good because he&rsquo;s from. Slytherin family and everything, right? His his character is meant to be. Yeah. Evil. Yeah. Right. So yeah. OK, so that&rsquo;s a really interesting counterpoint that that he breaks. Good. All right, next one. We&rsquo;re going to listen to. So going back to that initial idea of moments in where movie character breaks, it reaches a breaking point. Let&rsquo;s listen now to Harvey Dent, Dark Knight, DC comic books, the villain character.
Taylor
Ohh 2 faced isn&rsquo;t it?
Craig
Face 2 face. There we go. So in Dark Knight. Take movie by. Christopher Nolan is going to say Christopher Columbus Christopher Nolan introduces Harvey. Dan very much sets him up as as the white knight, right. He&rsquo;s an idealistic District Attorney, but then he&rsquo;s broken right here. So what breaks this idealistic. Attorney District Attorney, let&rsquo;s listen to WIOR channel for Harvey dense transformation.
Speaker 13
Did you know? In the dark night, Harvey dense transformation into two face after being severely burned on one side of his face mirrors real life cases of individuals undergoing significant physical and psychological changes due to traumatic events. This powerful scene demonstrates how trauma can profoundly alter a person&rsquo;s identity and moral compass. Making it one of the most compelling and realistic portrayals of character transformation in cinema.
Speaker 1
You either die.
Craig
Well, let&rsquo;s see it. Emotional trauma. The emotional trauma, though, is this one.
Speaker 3
The explosion kills Rachel, which leaves Batman devastated since he intended to save her. However, he manages to rescue Harvey before he too is killed in the explosion, but Harvey is left severely disfigured and mentally destroyed by the tragedy.
Speaker
How?
Speaker 13
Did you know in?
Craig
The dark, so that&rsquo;s end of Act 2. What happens is the Joker challenges Batman and. Commissioner Gordon to save Rachel, who&rsquo;s the love interest of Batman and Harvey Dent, right. They&rsquo;re in two different locations. They&rsquo;ve both got bombs that are about to explode and.
Taylor
What&rsquo;s this in the movie?
Craig
Yeah, isn&rsquo;t there? And they&rsquo;ve gotta split up to rescue them. It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a set. Up for the?
Taylor
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, I do remember.
Craig
3rd app, right? So Batman goes to save Rachel and Attorney Commissioner Gordon goes to. Dave. Harvey Dent, but. The Joker has sprung a surprise and Batman was actually going to a Harvey dentist, right? Batman successful, says Harvey Dan, but thought it was Rachel. Commissioner Gordon wasn&rsquo;t successful. Rachel dies anyway, so it&rsquo;s that trauma where where Harvey Dent thinks that, right. It&rsquo;s interesting.
Taylor
Rubbish. Coming to school.
Craig
Again, the idea of Rutrum A is almost click on it.
Speaker 1
You either die a hero. Or you live long enough to see yourself.
Speaker 2
Become the villain.
Speaker 18
Store.
Speaker
Face Gotham&rsquo;s bright future.
Speaker 11
It&rsquo;s about what&rsquo;s.
Craig
Right. Yep. So that&rsquo;s again one of these. Other cliches of. Become the villain. You either die the hero or live long enough to become the villain. Interestingly, I saw that as a meme today where someone posted these frozen meals. That were Gordon Ramsay granted Gordon Ramsay&rsquo;s frozen pasta, Gordon Ramsay&rsquo;s frozen sausages. That yeah, you just put in the microwave to eat. It&rsquo;s like that&rsquo;s that concept. You either, you know, die early as the hero or you live long and become the the villain. So again, the idea there being if Harvey Dent had died in that second act explosion, he would have died.
Speaker 11
OK.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
Hero, right? Everyone would still have remembered him as the heroic. District Attorney. But then he justifies his sense of of revenge by, you know, he&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s he hasn&rsquo;t died, but he&rsquo;s now become the villain. Interesting one here is Jack Torrance&rsquo;s character in the shining.
Speaker
Hmm.
Craig
Not seeing it? Great horror film. Alright, it tells the story of the character Jack Torrance. It&rsquo;s a Stephen King novel based on Stephen King novel. This is a clip from the movie by Stanley Kubrick.
Taylor
I&rsquo;ve seen it.
Craig
Great. Well, there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s one horror film we&rsquo;re not talking about. The Jack Torrance played by Jack Nicholson and it&rsquo;s interesting, this, this, this, the art of narrative YouTube channel is is here presenting his theory on the breaking point for Jack Torrance&rsquo;s character. Why do we go from this character that is. Not crazy to by act too crazy. Crazy.
Speaker 18
Drove Jack Torrance crazy. I think the answer isn&rsquo;t as clear as you might believe. Any fan of the film could recite a combination of factors that contributed to Jack&rsquo;s Madness. The isolation of the Overlook Hotel, located in a remote area that is cut off from the outside world in the bleak white winter, the hotel&rsquo;s dark history of violence, or the ghosts of the former guests and employees who haunt Jack and torment him, bringing out his worst demons. And finally, Jack&rsquo;s own alcoholism and mental instability. All of these factors combined created the perfect storm that drove Jack to madness, but these all missed one important clue. Jack&rsquo;s complete inability to write in the absence of all other distractions, Jack is forced to confront.
Speaker
How&rsquo;s it going?
Speaker 18
The horrifying truth, his utter lack of talent. And that is.
Craig
Lack of talent, right? So the position that the our narrative is presenting is that it&rsquo;s because Jack. Torrance&rsquo;s cart has been deceiving himself. He&rsquo;s actually not a good rider. The whole thing is that he&rsquo;s gone to do the winter caretaker for this hotel, so he has time to write his great novel. As we see in the film, though, you know he doesn&rsquo;t. He&rsquo;s not actually able to write, and he becomes increasingly frustrated by his wife and his child. He turns to alcohol, but the core breaking points concept that this are narratives presenting is that it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s his own self delusion and self deceit. And craving for success, which has which is which has broken him, that he he cannot, he does not understand himself and he does not understand himself that ultimately he&rsquo;s just not a good writer. He&rsquo;s not capable of it. Let&rsquo;s let&rsquo;s have a look at Anakin Skywalker.
Speaker 18
Star Wars? Yep.
Taylor
OK.
Speaker 17
When did Anakin Skywalker fully embrace the dark side? Some believed it happened when he defied the Jedi Order to save Chancellor Palpatine from Mace Windu. Others think it was his rampage on Mustafar where he betrayed the wife he once held dear. The logical time was when he slaughtered younglings in the Jedi Temple. Yet we learn in the rise and fall of Darth Vader. That Anakin still thought of himself as Anakin when Emperor Palpatine crossed the lava shores of Mustafar to his apprentices burned body. It wasn&rsquo;t until he was sealed inside his life support suit and the emperor asked Lord Vader if he could hear him that Darth Vader realised Anakin was God. It was upon learning that his wife and child were dead at his own hands, that Vader lost all hope. His wife was gone forever, leaving him devoid of love. And in that moment he fully surrendered to the dark side.
Craig
Yeah. So I mean there&rsquo;s a number. Of moments in. The film, where the character of Anakin does a number of bad things. Right, killing the younglings. Most people would say, is a moment. Where he he&rsquo;s broke. Right. He&rsquo;s a breaking point.
Taylor
No, that was valid.
Craig
Yeah, well, this is what? This this is what Star Wars apprentice is saying. That&rsquo;s not actually the breaking point, because he still sees himself as Anakin, right? Still redeemable. I guess his argument is it&rsquo;s the moon, which not only is he encased in the life. Support system of the Darth Vader uniform, but he&rsquo;s told by Palpatine that you know his wife is dead as well. In fact, let&rsquo;s listen to that scene.
Speaker
Just help me save at least like.
Speaker 7
I can&rsquo;t live without.
Speaker 8
Where is she and your anger?
Speaker 11
No.
Speaker 7
I couldn&rsquo;t. She was alive. I felt it.
Craig
Ohh alright yeah. So the idea being that yeah, it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s that moment in which. He he thinks he&rsquo;s killed his wife. Well, she does die, actually, after his church forced hold on her. Yeah, so. I I can&rsquo;t, you know, so there there&rsquo;s some interesting thoughts there around writing evil characters. My takeaway actually is the point that. That you&rsquo;ve got to think of yourself as a character&rsquo;s attorney, right? You can&rsquo;t just reduce the character to being. I need a bad guy, so he&rsquo;s just irredeemably bad. Make yourself the characters attorney, understand that every character sees themselves as heroic or the centre of the movie. Or not kind of, you know, kind of non functional evil, right? They they see themselves as justified. Yeah. For the actions they&rsquo;re taking. So that&rsquo;s media mothership for this week. Do we have? Another show after.
Taylor
This no, but I we&rsquo;re. I&rsquo;m going to run some tests to make sure that what I&rsquo;ve got will work so.
Craig
Great. Fascinating. Alright. Well, keep listening then to Edge radio. We&rsquo;ve got some some great tunes coming in. Think about those ideas of breaking point moments and characters right? What movies have you seen, where there&rsquo;s been a breaking point moment? Events that&rsquo;s caused the character to turn evil.

  Craig
Alright, alright. Just an echo goes from the machine. I don&rsquo;t know what that was. This is media mothership though on Edge Radio 99.3 FM and I&rsquo;m your host, Craig, joined by co-host Taylor. Hello. Special guest Marcus.
Marcus
Howdy. How are?
Craig
We going, we are all locked in now. And I feel I.
Marcus
Feel good, Chad, are we?
Craig
Locked in and we&rsquo;ve got all systems green on on streaming, so we are indeed streaming on YouTube and Twitch as well as on the Internet WW. Edgeradio.org dot AU do people still say WWW in front of URL these days? Is that dropped?
Taylor
I didn&rsquo;t say it. Yeah, I think.
Craig
I. It&rsquo;s dropped. Alright, well, edgeradio.org dot AU also has a streaming. On media mothership, we explore how media shapes the reality around us and as we deep dove into a few weeks back with understanding. The Donald Trump Zelinski fall out through the John Cena Hilton, we&rsquo;re updating that now with our exploration of the latest WrestleMania event. 2041 so all that and more coming up. On medium mothership.
Marcus
That was brilliant. I I think it was the little grin that sold for me.
Craig
I&rsquo;m getting better. I&rsquo;m getting better. So, WrestleMania 41, let&rsquo;s set it up with a little bit of an explanation. Right. So we&rsquo;re submitting 41 in my notes, notes that I&rsquo;ve put together via ChatGPT, I confess, which is why it&rsquo;s so great you&rsquo;re here, Marcus. Just to Fact Check all of this information. So it was. It was in. OK, well, I think this is. Already wrong is in. It was in. Las Vegas because it&rsquo;s saying here is in. Paradise, Nevada. No, it was in.
Marcus
Yes.
Craig
That&rsquo;s not a.
Taylor
Good start. Well, remember Chet, GPT is like 2 years out.
Craig
Ah. So this is actually copilot. Now he&rsquo;s copilot.
Taylor
You should have used grok.
Craig
OK, OK. So it says here next it was a two nights spectacle featuring WWE&rsquo;s biggest stars from Raw and Smackdown. Is that true? That&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s good.
Taylor
OK, that makes. Sense.
Craig
What&rsquo;s the difference between raw and smack down?
Marcus
The two the 2A shows of WWE Raw airs on Monday nights Smackdown airs on Friday nights, and they both have their own individual roster of wrestlers because they&rsquo;re the the roster is that loaded, they need 2-3 hour shows to get everyone on.
Speaker
France.
Marcus
There. And they also have different titles that are defended. On them at this point in time, RAW has got the World Heavyweight Championship, the. Women&rsquo;s World Championship and the Intercontinental Championship men&rsquo;s Yep, plus the women&rsquo;s tag team belts and one of the men&rsquo;s tag team belts. There are two men&rsquo;s tag team belts, but it&rsquo;s just like the world belts and the WWE belts. Like how what&rsquo;s the difference and on on smack down they have got the undisputed championship, which is seen as the premiership. On women.
Speaker
What is?
Marcus
The main title, which is more important than the world heavyweight, even though some of them are heavyweights, it&rsquo;s got the women. Championship not to be confused with the Women&rsquo;s World Championship. They&rsquo;re two different titles. They also have the US men&rsquo;s, the US women&rsquo;s and one of the men&rsquo;s Tag team championships.
Craig
One of just hearing that list of belts and championships it did come across a YouTube short conspiracy theory about what sceners possible plan might be, which is to basically it sounds a bit like when the DC or Marvel Universe kills off all their superheroes and reboots with a year. One kind of fresh slate. Someone was saying that that scene is basically going to destroy the belts, right? These belts are going to be retired or something, and they&rsquo;re going to reboot. Some some championship narrative, does that make sense? Does that have you heard rumours? Is that is that an exciting thing that I&rsquo;ve said on?
Marcus
A look, it&rsquo;s it that has absolutely happened in wrestling promotions before CW in the dying days back in 1999, literally did a a company wide reboot reboot where all ongoing feuds. Stopped and all titles were vacated. And they didn&rsquo;t make things any better for themselves. They still went out of business. About 18 months later.
Craig
Because is there a barrier for entry in wrestling in terms of understanding the the storyline like there is in comics?
Marcus
And entering wrestling is extremely difficult because it is an ongoing narrative that goes back decades. It&rsquo;s very hard to find a point to slot into probably the best time to start watching. Even then, you&rsquo;re still gonna, you know, be missing a lot of context. Because. Needs to be a very high turnover for wrestlers because they used to be on the road performing 300 days a year. Yeah, massive injury, massive burnout, a lot of problems with substance abuse. So generally speaking, the rest would only be at the top of the card for three or four years, and then they&rsquo;d be gone these days because you know, they actually get time off and actually get to look after themselves. A lot of wrestlers. On the on the show right now, I&rsquo;ve been on there for 10-15 years, so there&rsquo;s less turnover, which means the storylines are, you know, they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re longer and there are more implications. If there&rsquo;s any one time of the year, but also it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s odd because even though there&rsquo;s this convoluted back story to every rest and promotion, it&rsquo;s only people only watch for a couple of years. Jim Jim Cornett, who was a Booker for many years, has coined what he calls the seven year rule. Basically, every seven years, there will be enough of a turnover in wrestling fandom.
Speaker
Where&rsquo;s?
Marcus
And enough people will have stopped watching because they will have grown out of it that you can start telling the same story again. No one. Notice.
Craig
Where are we at that cycle? Do you?
Marcus
Think it&rsquo;s a very ongoing thing. I think with with the other thing is that he coined that prior to the Internet, so it used to be a show it there once, like a weekly show it there once like very rarely get repeated unless you know there was a marathon or something along those lines or a highlight reel.
Craig
Yeah.
Speaker
Right.
Marcus
And if you wanted to watch a paper, you had to hunt.
Craig
Down the videotape of it. But now, with the Internet, as we&rsquo;ll be dipping into tonight, that information is quite easy to hand. You can see replays. It is because it is. I mean, one of the things that is different at the moment is, is the distribution through Netflix has broadened its engagement. So now can you watch raw if you have Netflix accounts at the moment, right?
Marcus
If you have, if you have Netflix, you can watch raw and smack down. I&rsquo;m pretty sure you can watch NXT, which is the developmental B show.
Craig
Live like pretty close. To where it&rsquo;s being added in the US.
Marcus
Yeah, they they broadcast it live here.
Craig
As well. Wow. Right. Yep. So you can. We are at a I think when I was chatting with you about WrestleMania, it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a Golden Age. Would you say in terms of? It&rsquo;s engagement at the moment, it&rsquo;s popularity. It&rsquo;s profile.
Marcus
It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s definitely in its third major boom period of sort of the last 40 years because there was the initial rise of hulkamania and then, you know, after after the steroid trial in the early 90s, wrestling in general took a massive downturn from the early. The mid 90s started coming back up with WCW, which was then WWE&rsquo;s rival with the New World Order Angle in 1996 and WWF responded with the Attitude era, which sort of late 97 early 2001 where the rock and stone cold were at the top of the ladder and then the business took a massive nosedive after WCW went out of business and the. The there was some questionable booking decisions following the end of the attitude era and now this is the third major boom period 24 years later.
Craig
So yeah, clearly Netflix has also seen this as. As a a good thing to bankroll and WrestleMania. So this was WrestleMania 41 which was which is the first WrestleMania to air on Netflix. We&rsquo;re just here that it&rsquo;s the highest grossing and most viewed WrestleMania in WWE history. Have you come across any data? Suggesting that it&rsquo;s the sense that this WrestleMania. Was shattering. Records of attendance or merchandise.
Marcus
It it didn&rsquo;t shatter records of attendance, it would have shattered records of the gate that they made because they keep jacking up the price on. The. Tickets, so it absolutely will. I I absolutely believe that it&rsquo;s the highest grossing mania just because of how overpriced the. Tickets have become.
Speaker 5
Uh.
Marcus
I mean, really wanted to 1997 WrestleMania 13, which has one of the greatest matches ever, and you know they was they were giving tickets away because no one wanted to see it and also had the lowest buy rate ever. But the the thing about me 41 is that yeah, I I believe that, but also it it demonstrably doesn&rsquo;t have. It doesn&rsquo;t have the highest attendance because there are.
Speaker
Hello.
Marcus
The the arena they&rsquo;ve they&rsquo;ve wrestled in bigger in stadiums. Rather they&rsquo;ve wrestled in bigger stadiums. They&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;ve they&rsquo;ve been I think 3.
Craig
Right.
Speaker
Yeah.
Marcus
Wrestlemanias that have had over 100,000 people in the building at.
Craig
The same time I do like imagining what the views like from those Nosebleed seats right at the.
Marcus
Back there are YouTube or Facebook shorts where you see people actually they pull out their phones and they zoom in to the TV screen above the ring. By it&rsquo;s utterly woeful. At that point. You&rsquo;re not there to see a match. You are there to experience. The crowd.
Craig
The atmosphere. Yeah, we should. Still be good. All right, so major storylines that went down. So it says here the event featured John Cena&rsquo;s final WrestleMania match where he defeated Cody Rhodes to win the undisputed WWE Championship, marking his record 17th world title is.
Marcus
That yes, that was one of the major stories going in. Just to just to answer a question from Paul, when you asked the best time to start watching the best time.
Craig
That happened. Yeah, yeah.
Marcus
To watch wrestling, it&rsquo;s probably to start. It is the beginning of January.
Craig
Ohh really. So there&rsquo;s an entry point there. At the start of.
Marcus
The year? Yep. Because at the start of January, they&rsquo;re building to the first major premium live event of the year, the Royal Rumble, which happens in late January, early February. And whoever wins the Royal Rumble gets a title shot at one of the major belts at Wrestle Mania, so that way that that crowns the number one contender for the biggest show of the year. So the story that they&rsquo;ve told going in with Sina is that he announced last year it was going to be his last ever year. He&rsquo;s doing his retirement run. It was going to be his last Royal Rumble. It was going to be his last. Domination chamber, so Royal Rumble determines who challenges for one belt elimination chamber happens after it determines who&rsquo;s going to challenge for the other belt. I remember thinking. All right, cool. Well, he&rsquo;s not winning the rumble then because he&rsquo;s not going to. Be the elimination chamber. If he wins the rumble. So. Came second at the Rumble and then won the Elimination chamber under dodgy circumstances, and there was that famous heel tone where they&rsquo;d been teasing that Cody was gonna turn evil, but actually it was Sina who aligned himself with the rock.
Craig
Really. So there was some teasing there, Cody.
Marcus
Oh yeah. He&rsquo;ll turn. So Cody Rhodes was previously the undisputed champion and the and the top baby face of the company. Like the main guy of the company. And there was this bit with rock, the rock trying, who&rsquo;s sort of the main villain. Like he&rsquo;s like Doctor Claw from Inspector Gadget trying to corrupt. Cody and take his soul and in the end, Cody told him to go and F himself and. But then it turned out the action. People thought that there was going to be a twist with Cody turning heel, but the. Actual twist was.
Craig
That scene I turned heel. So cultural impact with appearances from celebrities like Travis Scott and.
Speaker
Alright.
Craig
And the return of Becky Lynch, WrestleMania 41 reinforced WWE&rsquo;s influence in Mentor Entertainment. Travis Scott, Peggy Lynch. What&rsquo;s? What&rsquo;s that?
Marcus
We&rsquo;ll start with Becky Lynch first, because that&rsquo;s much easier. Becky Lynch is she&rsquo;s been one of WWE&rsquo;s top wrestlers for about 7 or 8 years, not just one of the women wrestlers. One of the top wrestlers, full stop. She just took eleven months off after her last contract ran out to spend time. With her daughter. And there was absolutely no announcement that she was going to be back. She joined in. With layer of Alqueria whose tag team partner had been injured. And so when Becky comes back at the at the at the at WrestleMania with absolutely no warning when her theme music hits, everyone went nuts.
Craig
Right, right. And again, it&rsquo;s that theme music and the audience picks up and and the sense of. You know, cultural impact that this.
Speaker
Yeah.
Craig
Figure.
Marcus
So that was Becky Lynch. Being there was a big one for wrestling fans. Travis Scott being there is this very bizarre thing that Triple H has been doing where so for anyone who&rsquo;s unaware, Triple H is the Booker that had the head head of content where he went to a random Travis Scott concert last year and gave Travis Scott the ******** belt which he revived. And they&rsquo;ve done this.
Craig
A music concert.
Marcus
Yeah, went to an actual cause. Travis Scott&rsquo;s, you know, Grammy Award winner, sells out really big venues and yeah, Triple H went and gave him the ******** belt at a concert, and they&rsquo;ve done this what they&rsquo;ve done with it is really strange because they&rsquo;ve essentially turned Travis Scott into. I guess the Silver Surfer surfer to the rocks, Galactus or like he&rsquo;s the like the mouth of Sauron where he he just randomly appears but he doesn&rsquo;t actually say anything. He really do anything he used appears and will occasionally like try to hit someone in the ring and that&rsquo;s all he does. Like he&rsquo;s contributed nothing other than a couple of cheap shots to Cody. Rhodes.
Craig
Right.
Marcus
And yeah, it was just. So. This is one of those moments where everyone knows that wrestling is predetermined. It&rsquo;s scripted. It&rsquo;s not a real conflict, and people get frustrated with Ohh man Travis Scott at WrestleMania 41 really stunk up the joint and people say, you know, it&rsquo;s not a real fight. You know that it&rsquo;s not real. Yeah, but it&rsquo;s still bad storytelling because.
Speaker 5
Was.
Marcus
The match that Cena had with Cody was not very good because.
Craig
At WrestleMania, it was.
Marcus
Atrocious. And the reason it&rsquo;s atrocious is because the storyline they&rsquo;re going for is that people have been asking for Cena to turn heel and become a bad guy for 22 years because they got sick of him a very long time ago and there. But he&rsquo;s been part time for the last 10 years. And it&rsquo;s weird because he was a babyface for so long. Everyone booed him when he was a full timer because they hated him and they were sick of him. And then when he became a part timer, all of a sudden they loved him. They couldn&rsquo;t get enough of him and they wanted him to come back. And so the problem is that his his heel turn and it&rsquo;s like he could have just coasted by and just played the hits and give people what they want. Over the last year. But he&rsquo;s actually, you know, trying something new with the heel turn. But it&rsquo;s just not really working because he&rsquo;s acting indignant towards the audience for the the negative reactions that they gave him.
Craig
All right.
Marcus
10 years ago. Whereas the last 10 years they&rsquo;ve loved him and it&rsquo;s just there&rsquo;s a really big disconnect between his reason for turning heel. But the way the fans are actually treating him in.
Craig
Right. Real life. Yeah. So I guess the script that he&rsquo;s. Working with and on is that he? Yeah. Has given so much to the fans. The fans are keep taking from him. It&rsquo;s too much and that kind of. Antagonism towards the fans that that, yeah, maybe it has an old. History to it, but.
Marcus
It&rsquo;s just and the the, the core tenet of a heel. The the main principle of a heel is that you don&rsquo;t cheer the heels you Boo for them. And so a lot of wrestlers, when they turn heel, will deliberately stop doing the flashy moves that everyone loves because they don&rsquo;t want people to cheer for them. So Seina has completely stripped back his style, and this is the first match he&rsquo;s wrestled. The heel. He hasn&rsquo;t wrestled once in the lead up between the the elimination Chamber and Mania seven weeks. Cody didn&rsquo;t defend the belt once since the rumble, so it&rsquo;s over two months. So going in this very strange lack of heat, I suppose, and seeing as just deliberately, he kept on stepping outside of the ring so that he couldn&rsquo;t get pinned. He, like the match, couldn&rsquo;t legally end, and it was an obvious he&rsquo;ll take to get the audience to vote for him. But the audience kept on cheering. Actually, it&rsquo;s a bit of an odd one because. Like people comparing it to rock versus Hogan at Mania 18. Oh yes, where the rock was the the baby face. And Hogan was the irritable villain. But they they cheered for Hogan and they booed for the rock. But this, they just sort of the audience sort of booed for everyone they booed, seen it when they were supposed to. They booed code.
Craig
Yeah.
Marcus
He because I guess they&rsquo;ve gotten sick of him. But it&rsquo;s also because, like, and it goes back to one of the strangest things about WWE, the last sort of 1520 years is the disconnect between the people who are in the stadiums and arenas watching these major events and the people watching at home. Because the people who are watching it in the stadiums and and the arenas. They are the people with the disposable income who are super nostalgic for what they watched when they were kids. So that was one of the reasons why. When Rock went up against seeing it about 10 or 12 years ago, they were they. Everyone was booing, seeing out of the building cause they hated him, hated him. But they grown up watching the rock during the attitude era, so they were cheering to see him back, whereas the kids at home will be cheering. Seen it because he&rsquo;s their favourite wrestler and now we&rsquo;ve got the people who are in the stadium to see senior versus Cody.
Craig
Hmm.
Marcus
Grew up watching senior at home. They were the kids cheering for senior at home. While the stadiums are booing him. And so now they&rsquo;re cheering. For him, and it&rsquo;s just very strange, and it was just not an entertaining match and it just ends with Travis Scott coming out. He&rsquo;s, yeah, seen hits. And everyone&rsquo;s like, oh, he&rsquo;s here. The rock&rsquo;s gonna be here. And the rock&rsquo;s not there. It&rsquo;s just Travis Scott awkwardly walks to the ring holding the ******** title and takes him a solid 4 minutes to walk to the ring. Like the entrances in WWE have been ridiculously long. Last couple of years, but 4 minutes it takes.
Craig
Was he walking slowly? High fiving.
Marcus
He was walking slowly. He&rsquo;s working heel. So he wasn&rsquo;t high fiving. He was just awkwardly staring at Cody and seeing it the entire. Way to the ring. It was terrible. It was awful, and then when he gets the, Cody distracts him and it&rsquo;s just he tries to distract Cody and Cody hits him, he gets revenge for the beat down that Cody got from him and seen her and rocket elimination chamber. It&rsquo;s just strange. Why is this happening and? More to the point, the thing that always breaks my suspension of disbelief because nothing requires more suspension of disbelief. The professional wrestling, if you can get into it, it&rsquo;s great, but if you stop to think about it, it makes no sense. And so why is it that Travis Scott is coming out here to help Selena? But none of Cody&rsquo;s allies are coming out to save him? Why, they just letting this happen?
Speaker
Hmm.
Craig
Yeah, interesting. I mean, as videos watching at moments where wrestling has broken the 4th wall and they try and. Talk about that. Manufactured moment, but just before we get past WrestleMania so it says historic matches. Seth Rollins won a dramatic triple threat match against CM Punk and Roman Reigns, with Paul Heyman&rsquo;s shocking betrayal adding to the drummer. So that was what it&rsquo;s defined as a historic match. How was that as a counterpoint to the? You know, seen a match? The the triple threat.
Speaker
Ohh.
Marcus
Match just just to get some context. So WrestleMania for the 1st 35 years was a one night event and then after a 7 hour mania they went. This is ridiculous and they started making it a two night.
Craig
Event and so when was it a one night? It was a.
Marcus
One night, up until a few years, for 36 years, WrestleMania.
Speaker
Feel.
Marcus
911 night event or one day event cause like the last few went for.
Craig
7 hours. That&rsquo;s a long.
Marcus
Event the like for Mania 35 the main event. I think the main event started at midnight. And the main event is usually one of, if not the longest matches on the card and then after it finished you know 80,100 thousand people then have to get in their cars and go home. So the traffic is ungodly.
Craig
Alright, really. Alright, so then over 2 nights. So the triple threat match was the first night.
Marcus
Yes, sorry. So the point that I that, that, that that I was getting to with that is that there&rsquo;s a lot of discussion over whether or not cause the main event is the last event of a show. But there&rsquo;s some discussion as to whether or not night 1 of WrestleMania Constitu. Roots our main event, or if it is the midpoint of the whole weekend.
Craig
Right. And I guess by that also the bragging rights, yes. To to be that in that event.
Marcus
And the storyline going in, which is very much a real life storyline, is that so there were three guys CM Punk rename Phil Brooks, Seth Rollins, real name Colby Lopez and Roman Reigns, real name Joanna I. So in cafe these three wrestlers all hated each other and they&rsquo;ve been they&rsquo;ve been building this story for about 18 months in real life. The real story going on was that Phil Brooks, who plays CM Punk. Had been at the top of the card in the early 20 tens, but and he&rsquo;s a long time wrestling fan but had never gotten to main event WrestleMania, even when he was the champion. They would put Cena versus rock on at the end of the night rather than him and he was supposed to main event night one last year. The planner seemed to win the elimination chamber and challenge for the World Heavyweight belt.
Craig
Really.
Marcus
But he got his tie, his tricep torn in the Royal Rumble. And so he. Had to sit out the.
Craig
Tricep tour was was an accident, one of.
Marcus
Those unfortunate it was an accident. He was very injury prone for a couple of years. He seems to be better now. I think he&rsquo;s learned how to work safer. But it the the benefit is that it ended up leading into the best feud of the year where they went. So this guy, Drew McIntyre, has accidentally injured him. Right. OK, cool. Let&rsquo;s write that into the story. And these two can have a really great food out of it. Yeah. But base of the story was Punk wanted his main event and they gave him the main event night one against Rollins and Rains.
Craig
Yeah, right.
Marcus
And people are saying, well, is it a real main event? If it&rsquo;s not the final match of the weekend? But basically the three of them put on an incredible triple threat match SO1V1V1 notice qualification. Whoever gets the first pinfall is the winner and the storyline going in is that Paul Heyman, who in real life is a wrestling Booker, a wrestling promoter, has been for 40 years, generally a manager of heels or heels, stables. Had been working with Roman Reigns throughout four or five years because reigns for the longest time couldn&rsquo;t cut a promo to save his life. Paul Heyman and Sam Punk in real life, very good friends going back to ECW and Ring of Honour. And so the the storyline going in was that Hayman had to leave, had to leave Roman Reigns and be in CM Punk&rsquo;s corner. And then at the climax of the match, he&rsquo;d betrayed them both and allies himself with Seth Rollins and the. Even though in isolation it was a great match and there&rsquo;s a really beautiful moment where it&rsquo;s only been done on fan cams, well, you know, phones after the match ended. But off to the end of the match, everyone everyone else leaves and it&rsquo;s just Sam punk in the ring by himself and he&rsquo;s just overcome with emotion. He kisses the the ring and he&rsquo;s in tears and they start playing his music as. He. Leaves. Yeah. So they were like, yeah, this is your main event. You&rsquo;ve earned this. Congratulations. We we really appreciate you. And now they&rsquo;ve just on on raw 2 nights later on the Monday night, they&rsquo;ve gone straight into. Alright cool so. Rolands and Paul Heyman have now started a heel faction, and that&rsquo;s going to be our so Rowlands has been a baby face for a few years now. Everyone loves him. They sing his theme song and everything, and they&rsquo;re like, this is gonna be our new storyline moving forward. This is this heel faction with Rolands and with Hayman and CM, Punk is going to be 1 of. The main opponents and the.
Craig
I mean, it was such a delightful. You know, almost like silent movie performance that was done during that night of betrayal, as the Paul Heyman character, like he&rsquo;s dressed. In a suit. Right. And he comes out and you know, he&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s like watching a silent film in terms of his emoting so strongly with his face. And his mannerisms? Yeah. Ohh. I&rsquo;m in a real dilemma. What am I going to do? And and I&rsquo;ve seen a couple of fan videos of of this this performance because it&rsquo;s one thing I guess seeing it with the choreography. It&rsquo;s another thing when you get the immediacy of it. It&rsquo;s.
Speaker
Hmm.
Craig
You know, it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s so delightfully hand fisted and and clearly his, I guess chewing the scenery with that. And then he goes up like the nature of his betrayal was, what was it like was nut shots for breaking up.
Marcus
Not shots if you if.
Craig
You. Hitting them.
Marcus
In the nuts, if you want someone to turn, he&rsquo;ll get them to punch another man. In the zones. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Craig
Yeah, because there&rsquo;s been a lot of. I mean, that&rsquo;s what the the, the scene that he&rsquo;ll turn with Cody Rhodes was kicking him in the nuts. The Bohemian betrayal of CM Punk, and who was it? Was it rains, the.
Marcus
Other way? Yeah. Betrayed rains and punk insider.
Craig
Was. Yeah, cooling behind them. And then and then nodding them from behind them.
Marcus
Rawlins.
Craig
Through their legs. It was.
Marcus
And it&rsquo;s been a thing. For one of the most. Infamous heel turns in all of wrestling. Not no, not all of wrestling in the modern era. Rather, is or one of the most infamous in terms of the most badly hand. Old Ones 2018, I believe they had Shinsky Nakamura, who&rsquo;s known as the King of strong style. One of the biggest new. Japan wrestlers. Ever. Came to WWE after an extremely storied and successful career in Japan, won the Royal Rumble, got a title and everyone went nuts. I was singing his theme song that was so happy for him. He got into a World Heavyweight Championship match against AJ Styles, who he previously had really great matches with in Japan. The match they had was very mediocre, Shinske lost and then turned heel by punching AJ Styles in the nuts and literally that was that was the nature of their feud. From then on it was that Shinsky had an obsession with trying to get AJ styles and the cajones. It&rsquo;s just is this.
Craig
And when was. Your ohh right right?
Marcus
2018-2019 Vince McMahon basically just going oh, he&rsquo;s Japanese and he can&rsquo;t speak great English. He&rsquo;ll never make it on the mic so. I can&rsquo;t. Have him as a top guy and. He&rsquo;s just never shinsky Nakamura never recovered from. That it&rsquo;s just.
Craig
That, that he&rsquo;ll turn and yeah, and.
Marcus
It&rsquo;s sad, but on the other, on the other hand, you get paid 6 figures a year to hang out.
Craig
In Florida and serve something feel too bad for him. So wrestle Mania 41 was more than just wrestling events. It was a global spectacle blending sports, entertainment and storytelling at an unprecedented scale.
Speaker 1
OK.
Craig
I&rsquo;ve got some YouTube shorts. We&rsquo;ll play them. I&rsquo;ve I&rsquo;ve just grabbed some media that&rsquo;s been circulating recently, so this this is from 2 weeks ago. The title is the rock ruined WWE WrestleMania 41. So here this is a fan theory. It goes for 17 seconds.
Marcus
Go for.
Craig
So we&rsquo;ll we&rsquo;ll play it and we&rsquo;ll get your feedback. Sorry.
Speaker 5
Is back at elimination chamber and and gets the big moment and he shows up at bad blood and gets the big moment with the bloodline thing. You know, he shows up at these random events, these random moments, and he basically comes whenever he feels like it and then he&rsquo;s not actually committed to the schedule and he&rsquo;s not able to do this full time.
Speaker 6
Now.
Craig
All right, so so he&rsquo;s complaining about rock. What was what? What was the nature of rock crew in WWE WrestleMania 41 that? This fans complaining about.
Marcus
He ruined it because he had set up over several appearances that date back to bad blood of last year, which is, I think, around sort of September, October, he&rsquo;d been slowly building up this idea of like him and seeing it being this new dangerous alliance. He&rsquo;s the main villain. He tried to corrupt Cody Rhodes. He&rsquo;s got history. The whole bunch of people in the roster, everyone was expecting and and last year he was in the main event of Night 1 and he interfered in the main event of Night 2. Everyone&rsquo;s expecting because he&rsquo;s the main villain of WWE. Essentially, that would be this, some kind of involvement to progress the story. And he just wasn&rsquo;t there. He he&rsquo;s just this non entity as far as the story is concerned. Even though he he was and one of the reasons why seeing as he&rsquo;ll turn initially was so well received, he says oh, there&rsquo;s the intrigue of he&rsquo;s working with rock. What&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s gonna happen in the story and then it just degrades into the scene is saying I hate I&rsquo;m here now because the audience is.
Craig
Mean to me. And as you were saying, Trevor Scott appeared rather than the. Rock. Yeah, at the end.
Marcus
And what&rsquo;s he doing there? No one knows. He doesn&rsquo;t say anything. He just appears, tries to hurt, hit Cody and gets whacked in return.
Craig
And that&rsquo;s it. So do you think the rock ruins WWE WrestleMania 41?
Marcus
I think if he was going to insert himself into the build, he should have been at WrestleMania. If he wasn&rsquo;t gonna be at WrestleMania, he should not have been part of the build. It&rsquo;s basically you&rsquo;re giving us the first two acts of a story and not delivering the third.
Craig
Next clip is who should dethrone John Cena for the undisputed WWE Championship. This was from. 8 days ago.
Speaker 6
That John Cena is a 17 time world champion. It kick starts a whole new exciting phase of his final WWE run. We know that he isn&rsquo;t going to retire with the WWE title intact, but there&rsquo;s a good chance he holds on to it for at least half of the remaining 8 months he. That&rsquo;s so who should be the one to dethrone him? It depends on whether he&rsquo;s still a heel or not. By the end of the year. If he continues in this direction, the logical choice is to have Cody Rhodes regain the title as it gives them a full circle moment and something to chase again. If Cena turns baby face, then the best call might be to either have Gunther dethrone him in a dream match. Or Seth freaking Rollins to get one over on his old rival one last time.
Craig
All right, so a classic kind of speculation of, could Sina turn baby face?
Speaker
The one paper.
Craig
Could there be another match between Cody Rhodes? Well, how did you feel about that unpacking of? Who should dethrone John Cena for the undisputed?
Marcus
In theory, it makes sense for senior and Cody to have a rematch, and for Cody to get his win back and get the belt back and be the top guy again. But I feel that&rsquo;s really risky because. The audience were all there for Cena and they weren&rsquo;t there for Cody.
Craig
So right, they&rsquo;re just saying they were booing Cody right where they should be cheering him.
Marcus
Yeah, he&rsquo;s a good.
Speaker
Guy.
Marcus
When a year previously, they&rsquo;ve all been clamouring for him to finish his story, there&rsquo;s that whole story about how. Dwayne Johnson, the rock in Real Life, had tried to oust Cody from the main event of WrestleMania 40 because he wanted it for himself and everyone took to Twitter to get hashtag. We want Cody trending, and there was this huge real life story about getting Cody back in the main event to follow the creator of the Triple H Him planning and everyone was behind him then, and then they turned on him at Wrestle Mania and the smack down before Wrestle Mania. So I&rsquo;m thinking I don&rsquo;t think putting Cody and Cena in a rematch is. Fairly safe if anything. They also said Gunther. Right. Gunther. Yeah. Gunther would be interesting because to have Gunther challenging for the undisputed belt would be a lot of fun. He&rsquo;s based this really old school. He&rsquo;s very old school in terms of his move set. So power bombs, knife edge chops, sleeper holds. That&rsquo;s pretty much it. Very basic, very 19. I mean, he&rsquo;s also he&rsquo;s totally not Hitler.
Craig
Because it&rsquo;s very German, right? He&rsquo;s very German. Right? Austrian. So, Schwarzenegger.
Marcus
Australian. He&rsquo;s all switch back to there. During general Ohh the ring general yeah.
Craig
Is that his name? The the ring. The ring, general. Yeah. Like they&rsquo;re going a whole kind of wartime Prussian military.
Speaker
Freak.
Marcus
Comes on in a military great coat with opera playing.
Speaker
Sure.
Craig
It&rsquo;s that problematic. Does anyone say? Yeah, this is a bit problematic.
Marcus
Here&rsquo;s the what here is the thing.
Craig
It looks.
Marcus
Wrestling is frequently very problematic. It&rsquo;s always had a very, very sketchy relationship with race. I think this is just my interpretation. I could be wrong. The guy who plays Gunther, I don&rsquo;t know what his real name is. Sorry, but he is. He&rsquo;s charisma is, quite frankly, off the charts and he makes it work. I mean, the dude gets by with maybe four or five moves. And everyone loves him and thinks he&rsquo;s one of the best heels working today. So I think he pulls it off. I could be wrong, but I mean, they&rsquo;ve had other instances of racially insensitive gimmicks like Mohammed Hassan, whose gimmick was that he was a man of Arabic descent who felt that Middle Eastern people. Were being treated unfairly following 911. And he was a heel.
Craig
Ohh.
Marcus
Yeah, that lasted about six months and I&rsquo;m pretty sure he was played by an Italian American. Gosh, Ouch. There&rsquo;s a pretty sketchy history of race and and wrestling, but I think I think good that makes.
Speaker
Wow.
Craig
It work. Yeah, it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s tricky, isn&rsquo;t it, when the wrestlers also need to again do that 4th wall moment. And say hey. You know, I went there like I was watching something was like some good old boy, like wrestlers that were performing good old boys, anti immigration kind of narratives against a Mexican wrestler. That was the storytelling was around that kind of first Trump era, you know, trying to like clamp down on illegals. Kind of narrative and thinking that this, this wrestler is an illegal immigrant and taking our jobs kind of narrative and then there, yeah, there&rsquo;s a new saying. Well. This is a role. This is not my thoughts on that, though I did enjoy in the last wrestle like Pre WrestleMania we were talking about the match up. That didn&rsquo;t happen on the night, right, which was against the El Grande.
Marcus
Guy El Grande americano.
Craig
Which and. That&rsquo;s really political, right? This is a performance like you&rsquo;ve got the Gulf of America, Gulf of Mexico being renamed Gulf of America. So how have they wrapped that up as a narrative? Because you&rsquo;ve got some really exciting Mexican wrestlers in WWE. So what was that match meant to be on paper?
Marcus
It it ended up getting so it was meant to be El Grande Americano who?
Craig
Is sounds like a burger from.
Marcus
It really does. Or a burrito. Who is the rest of the Chad Gable wearing a luchador mask and pretending that he&rsquo;s?
Craig
Someone else, and no one knows that, right? It&rsquo;s like a secret identity. Like, who is he? I&rsquo;m a real Mexican.
Speaker 1
Aye.
Marcus
Wrestler the The, the, the the joke is that it&rsquo;s so obvious that it&rsquo;s Chad Gable, but people act as though it&rsquo;s not. He was meant to have a match against Rey Mysterio. Who is? Not even Mexican. He&rsquo;s of Mexican descent, but he&rsquo;s from San Diego. He&rsquo;s lived in California all of his life, but he&rsquo;s considered one of the very greatest. I don&rsquo;t think he he&rsquo;s even a necessarily practitioner of Lucha Libre. He&rsquo;s a luchador that he wears the mask. Yeah, but considered one of the absolute greatest sort of lightweight wrestlers. He was supposed to be.
Speaker 5
Right.
Craig
Ever, right.
Marcus
Those two, because he&rsquo;s been his Mysterio, has been on the roster for. He&rsquo;s been a wrestler for about 35 years. And still moves like an absolute demon, so it was meant to be those two against each other. But Mysterio ended himself and he got replaced with another luchador and it was a good match. But the story is still. Ongoing, I mean.
Craig
OK, watch it.
Marcus
There was there because the blow off didn&rsquo;t happen. I mean, Chad Gable still playing El Grande Americano. He&rsquo;s still feuding with the other luchadors on the roster.
Craig
Moving to the next little clip, Cena, after winning WWE title. Cody&rsquo;s reaction.
Speaker 7
Cody didn&rsquo;t said a word and walked out after losing his title, seen it in the press conference, said that he&rsquo;s just here so he won&rsquo;t get fined. He labelled all questions asked to him, including the Rock&rsquo;s involvement as clickbait questions, and said that it&rsquo;s lazy reporting, he said to tune in to raw tomorrow to see how he ruins wrestling. Becky Lynch tweeted that she&rsquo;s back and she brought her daughter rude to the press conference too. Fans are criticising the night 2 main event of Mania 41 because it was nowhere close to that of wrestle Mania 40. But Cena winning the title was the best decision, fans pointed out when last year the Rock said that he will be at Wrestle Mania 41, but the reality is different now. In the post Wrestle Mania, press conference, Triple H said that China will get a solo induction when the. And is right. Dominic was receiving a. You deserve it. Chant in the post show he may turn Babyface again after 2 1/2. Years. I think he gets another title.
Craig
All right. Well, that was very that human YouTube short there by the human voice, very AI based. So there&rsquo;s a lot to unpack there. So Cena did a post match press conference in character as a heel. Yes. Did that salvage some of the less than successful match that had that had happened or or was the the post match press conferencing is a fizzle itself.
Marcus
Or the scene heel turn is so strange because a lot of people are enjoying the character work that he&rsquo;s doing. There&rsquo;s just a disconnect. Between the initial. The altered and the his concurrent motivation and the timing of his motivation. The match I think was just bad by design because Cena in character is trying to make wrestling lame and he wants to retire and take the belt with him. He wants to take his ball and go home. It&rsquo;s an it&rsquo;s an unwritten rule that wrestlers should always lose their last match and they should never retire with the title. There are very few circumstances where that happens. People are loving. Your work, though, like he&rsquo;s so entertaining as a bad guy, it doesn&rsquo;t mean that the match wasn&rsquo;t. I didn&rsquo;t see any, though, Dominic Mysterio, who got the intercontinental belt, he&rsquo;s Rey Mysterio, son, and he&rsquo;s an example of where he was. Someone was hated. His baby face turned heel, hated as a heel. All the right reasons. And now he&rsquo;s turning baby faces. Everyone loves to hate him so much they they aren&rsquo;t. Ironically, love him.
Craig
Anything else from that? That, that little clip. What was it? It was.
Marcus
Ohh yeah, about how Cody didn&rsquo;t say anything.
Speaker 7
Cody didn&rsquo;t say.
Craig
Yeah. Cody said it. Yeah.
Speaker 7
Had a word and walked out after losing his title. Cena in.
Craig
The OK, so yeah. How do people unpack the post, Cody?
Marcus
Loss the out of the out of universe reason is that Cody Rhodes wants time off because his wife&rsquo;s having a.
Craig
Second kid. Ohh. OK, that&rsquo;s nice.
Marcus
So. The that&rsquo;s.
Craig
Yeah.
Marcus
So he dropped the belt and Cena also wanted to beat Ric Flair&rsquo;s record and have the most recognised title runs in WWE history, right, even though Ric Flair has something like 25 title runs, not all them acknowledged by WWE. I don&rsquo;t know why and I feel like I don&rsquo;t know. I feel like Cody. They have done some damage to his brand just the way that he&rsquo;s being portrayed the this year. Because one of his complaints against Roman Reigns last year and challenging for the belt was that Roman Reigns never defended it, he defends it once every two months, whereas Cody, while chasing that was also having feuds with the Judgement Day and Shins, gained like more on TV every single week. Right? And Cody&rsquo;s basically. But like in terms of the way. That he&rsquo;s being booked. Obviously you know Cody Runnels, who plays Cody Rhodes, doesn&rsquo;t write the story himself, but the way that he&rsquo;s being portrayed is not helping any potential fan backlash and.
Speaker 5
I don&rsquo;t know I.
Marcus
Don&rsquo;t know it&rsquo;s going when he comes back. Hopefully he comes back to heroes. Welcome but. It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s. It&rsquo;s an interesting the the the ultimate problem with wrestling is that heroes and villains, you know, baby faces and heels are not defined by what they do. They&rsquo;re defined by how the crowd responds.
Craig
To them. Yeah. Yeah. That the idea of heat, right? Generating audience excitement or.
Speaker
Yeah.
Craig
We&rsquo;re kind of back and forth.
Marcus
Yeah, if people cheer for you and you&rsquo;re a heel, well, turn babyface because they like you. Doesn&rsquo;t matter if you never do anything nice as long as you say that you&rsquo;re a baby face, they&rsquo;ll like. And if you&rsquo;re a face and you get booed, just turn heel and become evil and they&rsquo;ll be for the right reasons.
Craig
So the last point that this clip was making, what is it, Dominic? They&rsquo;re saying that.
Marcus
Daddy, Dom.
Speaker 7
Dominic was receiving a you deserve it. Chant in the post show he may turn Babyface again after 2 1/2 years.
Marcus
I think he gets another title.
Craig
What&rsquo;s it? What&rsquo;s it? You deserve it. First chat.
Speaker
Run.
Marcus
Ohh basically, if a wrestler who hasn&rsquo;t had a title for a while gets a title and it&rsquo;s well earned. Like if they&rsquo;ve been. One of the things that&rsquo;s really praised by wrestling fans is restless, who wrestle every week, who show up, and they put on good matches on a consistent basis. That&rsquo;s what people like. That&rsquo;s why Cody was so popular last year, cause that&rsquo;s what he was doing and Dominic Mysterio.
Craig
Who&rsquo;s a heel? And it looks like a complete.
Marcus
Who is this you?
Craig
And like weaselly little character, he&rsquo;s a great performance of kind of like.
Marcus
Yes. Yeah.
Craig
You know, I I&rsquo;d see this guy at. Coles or Woollies without shoes. Yeah, drinking the milk straight from the.
Marcus
Yeah. Carton absolutely, always chewing gum. He&rsquo;s like a core tenet of his character is his obsession with chicken tendies. I don&rsquo;t know why either.
Craig
It&rsquo;s like deep fried or something or crumbed chicken things.
Marcus
Crumbed chicken, usually frozen and put either in the deep fryer or in the oven. He hasn&rsquo;t. He literally. I saw one into you with him where he just like they were just two solid minutes just talking about chicken tendies. It&rsquo;s just an inherent part of his character. I don&rsquo;t know why. Yeah, but because he puts on good matches because he&rsquo;s so funny, everyone is able to see past the character he&rsquo;s playing to the fact that the performer is very talented and the performer is very entertaining. And The thing is that. Obviously, wrestling is scripted, but the belts ideally shouldn&rsquo;t go arbitrarily to whoever created thinks should have them. The belt should go to the people who are doing the best work, getting the best responses, and because once you&rsquo;ve got a belt, all our eyes are on you and you are going to be perceived as the person who&rsquo;s drawing.
Craig
Right.
Marcus
The money. So even though even though it&rsquo;s the belts are not competitive in athletic sense, they are competitive in, I suppose like a marketing and merchandising and a prestige sense. So they were chanting, you deserve it and because he&rsquo;s done such great work and he&rsquo;s barely wrestled on premium live event, I think he&rsquo;s been in a couple of tag matches and he was in a shark cage. For women&rsquo;s world title defence last year, but I don&rsquo;t remember him having a single singles match in the 18 months that I&rsquo;ve been watching. So for him to come out and have this like incredible. On on premium Live event, he&rsquo;s definitely had singles matches on RAW that always be very entertaining. So for him to come out and, you know, win this variant, attaining fatal Four way match the and the audience like this guy is a really performer. He&rsquo;s put on a good show. We are consider US sports entertained and that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m going. You deserve it. You deserve it.
Craig
I often hear that charm, as I mentioned in the studio here. Yeah. OK. So. Any other main points from Russell Mania, we&rsquo;ve. Missed.
Marcus
Ohh we we haven&rsquo;t mentioned Randy Orton&rsquo;s mystery opponent.
Craig
Yeah. What happened there that.
Marcus
OK, so they&rsquo;d spent 18 months building up a rivalry between not 18 months more like 6 months, building up a rivalry between Kevin Owens and Randy Orton 2. Of the very. Two of the most popular performers for very different reasons, Kevin Owens is seen as one of the most safe workers. One of the most talented workers, and like everyone loves to build him as a heel. But he puts on the best matches, had a he had a a, a ladder match with Cody earlier in the year that was ridiculously good and I like you look at it, you think how these guys not paralyse. Last and Randy Orton&rsquo;s on the roster for well over 20 years, one of the top baby faces, everyone loves him. They&rsquo;re they&rsquo;ve been building up because Randy, Randy needs some time off, so they wrote him out with inverted commas with Kevin Owens doing a pile package pile driver on him and quote unquote, breaking his neck at Crown Jewel last year. Translation. They just want. He just wanted some time off. But a couple of weeks before WrestleMania, Kevin Owens and this is actually really sad. Kevin Owens announced on Smackdown that he needed neck surgery and he was not going to be resting for the foreseeable future. But because you know it&rsquo;s wrestling, it&rsquo;s the art of deception. Yeah, people. Weren&rsquo;t sure if it was real or if it was part of the storyline, so he got a mixture of cheers and booze as he was leaving.
Craig
Ohh no.
Marcus
And then he went on. Chris Van Vleet&rsquo;s YouTube channel and said, Oh yeah, this is real. I actually have to have neck surgery. Ohh. But man, like, just for such a for such a respected worker for him to like get that response because people weren&rsquo;t sure if it was.
Speaker
Oh man. The thing is.
Marcus
Drill or not, so that threw out the planning for Wharton&rsquo;s match at Mania because that because that&rsquo;s a blow off. That was a very long time in the making, but what they did was there&rsquo;s a wrestler for total nonstop action, Joe Hendry, whose basic gimmick is what if Freddie Mercury, but you revision.
Craig
Really. Yeah. Wow. Yep.
Marcus
And essentially he got really popular. Last year he&rsquo;s wrestling for 10 or 15 years. He&rsquo;s got a he&rsquo;s got a masters in business and marketing, and he&rsquo;s also an ex professional musician. So he wrote his own theme song into the music video to it. And he has all these little bits he has where he will, like, turn around and smile at the camera. And it&rsquo;s just so ridiculously cheesy that you can. Not help but enjoy it. And so they go. Who&rsquo;s the? Who&rsquo;s the mystery opponent going to be? And Horton&rsquo;s in the middle of the ring. He&rsquo;s looking at the entranceway and you see the 2 doors open and it&rsquo;s all pitch black. And then you hear the first night lines, the things are going see his name and he appears and everyone absolutely lost it. And does turn and smile and the lights come up. And Joe Henry&rsquo;s there. Oh, my gosh, cause TNA. For many years, we&rsquo;ve seen as a very solid alternative to WWE. They never got anywhere close to their numbers. But basically, if you didn&rsquo;t like the product that WD was putting on, just TuneIn and watch TNA instead. So in the mid to late 2000s they were on this absolute roll and then some bad stuff happened and then they sort of recovered from it a little bit. Basically, Joe Hendry has been the shining point. He&rsquo;s the current. Main champion and he&rsquo;s been the main attraction over the last year. He was at the Royal Rumble earlier this year because WWE and TNA doing a lot of collaborations, right. And so everyone just lost it. Randy Orton is doing all these hilarious like not bad, like smiling. Nodding, and then you&rsquo;re hoping for a really good match. It&rsquo;s just a 3 minute squash match where Joe Hendry gets all of his bits in but and gets his crowd responses, but he&rsquo;s just there to get squashed by Randy Orton. Oh gosh. And but it climaxes with Orton trying Joe Hendricks poses for the audience into the camera. And it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a very good comedy bit, but as an actual and it&rsquo;s a very good mania moment because of that shock factor as an actual match though, like if they&rsquo;ve been given 10 minutes to. Work with it would have, but, but ultimately Triple H doesn&rsquo;t want to make the champion of another. Company look good. Right. Although people, I actually watched an interview with Henry not long after and the guy and the interview was like, do you feel like you were wasted at Mania and Joe Andrew said, look, I got to wrestle Randy Orton in his 20th WrestleMania at Wrestle Mania, so you know, no, I have no complaints. I can only go up from here. I&rsquo;ve I&rsquo;ve got a I&rsquo;ve got a trading card that a Topps trading card that&rsquo;s out. That&rsquo;s already sold out. That&rsquo;s gonna be worth a lot. Very. Soon, you know.
Craig
Trading cards, that&rsquo;s. So what do you think, Taylor? You hyped, is this hyping you into wrestling?
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
Where&rsquo;s your? What&rsquo;s your wrestling status at the?
Taylor
Moment I I haven&rsquo;t. I haven&rsquo;t watched the WrestleMania from last year or this year actually.
Craig
You you turn your bucket list of what was discussed is anything you&rsquo;re particularly excited to hear to see to.
Taylor
Yeah. OK.
Craig
Watch the nutjobs, the smashing, the testicles.
Marcus
All about the nut shots.
Taylor
I still actually do want to watch the ones from last year and this year it&rsquo;s just cause they&rsquo;re not free on YouTube. That I haven&rsquo;t watched, yes. What is the status?
Marcus
On and they do upload individual matches to YouTube and they they and. This thing where they uploaded the 50, quote unquote greatest Romanian matches. So a lot of them have been uploaded on YouTube before because there was blood in them, but they&rsquo;ve all been up like 50 of them have been uploaded. Some of them might be uploaded, they will never upload it. Chris Benoit match because he murdered his wife and child and then committed suicide.
Taylor
Yeah, yeah.
Speaker
Ohh. Oh.
Marcus
So even though he had an incredible career, no. 1. &lsquo;S No one&rsquo;s a big pardon me. Gonna wanna talk about him in WWE ever again. Yeah, most of the matches for and they even they uploaded individual rumbles as well, a whole bunch of royal rumbles are up there, whole bunch of elimination share matches are up there. So the only the only I guess they don&rsquo;t show you the height packages, but I think the hype packages their own videos anyway. So you can certainly watch most of a WrestleMania card on YouTube. If you&rsquo;re willing to tolerate the ads.
Craig
Yeah. Well, we&rsquo;re pretty much at time wrapping this up. What&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s around the corner? What&rsquo;s next on your excited wrestling calendar? Is there anything locally as well in in Australia that like?
Marcus
Oh, there are a bunch of smaller wrestling promotions in Australia, this Hazy Championship wrestling in Launceston. Does Adelaide Championship wrestling in I I don&rsquo;t know what, what, what city that&rsquo;s in, but there are a whole bunch of different wrestling promotions around Australia it&rsquo;s like.
Craig
Cause Australia does have some global representation in wrestling.
Marcus
Yes. I mean, we&rsquo;ve got. Grayson Waller and Maria Ripley, who I&rsquo;ve made just us. But yeah, no, they&rsquo;re I and they they often have a ring set up. I&rsquo;ve been to a bunch of pop culture conventions and anime conventions that have had wrestling matches on. They&rsquo;re always good fun to.
Craig
Right. Watch live. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So often if you go to a even. Just a popular culture convention that might have. You know Stormtroopers and anime cosplay often. You might also see a wrestling ring setup with people in the costumes wrestling.
Marcus
And there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s always a macho man cosplayer. There is always a macho man cosplayer.
Craig
That&rsquo;s and and and that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s that 80s macho man. Costume.
Marcus
With the with the, the the cowboy hat, his sunglasses with the plastic strips over them, the Teslas, the beard, the.
Craig
Performance right? Pink and yellow. How about hats?
Speaker 6
Ohh yeah, digger.
Craig
Just before we, I mean if if you could cosplay as any cosplayer, if you could cosplay as any rest. Well, from history do you have? Would you, would you think, geez, if I could, if I could pull that off, I would cosplay that wrestler in the.
Marcus
Heartbeat me personally, I would probably go as I&rsquo;d go as crow sting.
Craig
Is that like the comic?
Marcus
Book crew. Yeah, so.
Craig
Right. That kind of Gothic makeup.
Marcus
Yes, Sting started out in the 1980s as a surfer who wore bright colours and had face pain and a blonde flat top. And then in 1996, Scott Hall, who was a huge movie I&rsquo;ve. That, you know, reasons getting darker, you&rsquo;re going to be the main hero of this really dark. Storyline you should. You should become the crow. And so he literally had the crow make up for the last 25 years of 25 years of his.
Craig
Career. Wow. Yeah. Taylor, do you have any, you know, chunk out dog?
Taylor
No.
Craig
Actually, he&rsquo;s definitely not the because that&rsquo;s African American.
Marcus
Wrestler I can see Taylor doing Owen Hart.
Taylor
OK, OK. Yeah.
Craig
I reckon I could pull off. Someone. Yeah, maybe maybe the the. What&rsquo;s his name? The manager of CM Punk.
Marcus
Ohh, Paul Heyman, Paul Heyman. You do that or you could do a Gomez Adams looking. Do Paul Barrow. Who was the undertakers manager?
Craig
I can see Paul Heyman. Be deep cup. Yeah, I get fans. All right. Well, we&rsquo;re at. Time. Thanks for listening to me, Mother ship this week.

<p>Why do many Star Wars villains have British accents?</p>



<p>In this episode, we break down the significance of this choice using cultural theory and storytelling frameworks. Drawing from John Fiske&rsquo;s Textual Poaching, we explore how audiences interpret and reframe these portrayals. Stuart Hall&rsquo;s theories on representation, identity, and ideology help explain how accent and villainy intersect in mainstream media. Plus, Blake Snyder&rsquo;s Save the Cat framework sheds light on how storytelling conventions reinforce this trope.</p>

Craig
Alright, welcome here to Edge Radio 99.3 FM. This indeed is media mothership. For another exciting jam packed episode. We&rsquo;re broadcasting out of Edge Radio studios here in Nepal, Luna, Hobart TAS, and I&rsquo;m your host, Craig Norris. On this show, we explore how media can shape our understanding of the world around us, and we&rsquo;re streaming on edgeradio.org dot AU as well as. Live streaming on YouTube as well as twit.
Speaker
Which?
Craig
You can find us just by searching media mothership message us directly into the studio, either via our SNS on 0488811707 or send us a message on the YouTube or Twitch chat. This episode&rsquo;s gonna be quite interesting. We&rsquo;ve got some media news, media culture to go over, as well as some discussion of accents in movies and their significance. So keep listening. And today we&rsquo;ve got our live musical. Or kind of accompaniment with the beautiful sounds of the kalimba. There we go live in studio. So let&rsquo;s have a look at some interesting media news pieces that have come up over the last week or two so. Over in Japan, a Japanese actors dramatic Pok&eacute;mon save data loss has gone viral during traumatic memories and sympathy from fellow gainers. This is an article from IGN yesterday. The subtitle is even if save data disappears, the memories remain. Let&rsquo;s listen to a bit of the drama from the Japanese live streamer. So this. Actor Shinya Okada has been doing a video game, YouTube channel, and. He&rsquo;d. He&rsquo;d logged in to his what is it in his latest Let&rsquo;s Play video posted April 29th. Widest cheerful enthusiasm as the article says, to continue his Pok&eacute;mon Red Adventure gradually morphs into disbelief as the game asks him if he wants to start. From the beginning of Whitey&rsquo;s startled reaction of weigh. What as he realises that all the hours he has put into capturing and training Pok&eacute;mon have vanished. Our Pebble. Let&rsquo;s listen to that drama.
Speaker 3
Doing doing.
Speaker 4
Chuck.
Speaker
Sorry.
Speaker 4
Come on, not get up.
Speaker
Yeah.
Speaker 5
Argument. You should still go to generation.
Speaker
All good.
Speaker 4
Story torio.
Speaker
Hi. Close. And.
Craig
Alright. Yeah, thanks for listening to. That was a bit longer than I&rsquo;d expected, playing that great clip, but just to bring people up to speed, I don&rsquo;t know if your headphones working. Yeah. OK. I&rsquo;m. I&rsquo;m here now with co-host Taylor. Yeah. Hey. Hey. So what we&rsquo;re looking at at the moment. Is a Japanese actors dramatic Pok&eacute;mon save data loss that has gone viral yesterday during traumatic memories. So we were just listening to his YouTube clip collection there. This is from do you ever play the Pok&eacute;mon? Games. Come on mate. I&rsquo;ve had it. I know. Totally thank goodness for that. Yeah.
Taylor
Of course I have. But my first one was Ruby. I never played anything before that and then I went back.
Craig
OK.
Taylor
And played the originals.
Craig
Right, because this is the game he was playing was.
Taylor
Red blue.
Speaker 7
Or grim.
Craig
Pok&eacute;mon red. Yeah. Where does that? Where&rsquo;s Pok&eacute;mon red?
Taylor
That&rsquo;s the well the first. That&rsquo;s the first one.
Craig
Right, right, right. So.
Taylor
Red and blue in America slash the world red and green in Japan.
Speaker
Oh, really? Yeah.
Craig
Then why would they do?
Taylor
That I don&rsquo;t know, but that&rsquo;s why it was. That&rsquo;s why they redid it for the. Game Boy, when they redid it, it was fire red and leaf green and people like, well, why isn&rsquo;t it fire red and water blue? It&rsquo;s like well, because in Japan it was green. It was never blue.
Craig
Mind blown. I mean, I wonder how many comments we&rsquo;re gonna get. From that reaction because he. His his comment that he lost his save game quickly amassed 4.4 million views on the comments, so I&rsquo;m hoping SMS and now anyway so the because he posted that my Pok&eacute;mon Red Game Boy cartridge, so he I guess he was playing on an actual Game Boy. Control system rather than an email. Later, just vanished when he booted it up after X number of millions of hours playing it, and so he goes on seeing my remaining lifetime. I will not find another adventure to embark on. So rather dramatic. Yeah. So, yeah, he&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s unfortunate to have loss experience, attracted many sympathetic comments. People reminiscing about the sadness they&rsquo;ve felt when they&rsquo;ve lost valuable saves their children. Did you ever lose any saves? Particularly, I guess cartridge based systems like a Game Boy and 64 PS1 PS.
Taylor
I don&rsquo;t. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever had a loss like that. A corruption or anything like.
Craig
2 memory card.
Speaker 4
Correct.
Taylor
That I I take care of my thing.
Craig
I recently had that problem. Where.
Taylor
You save Scott.
Craig
Now what happened was, yeah, well, this was the game I&rsquo;ve been save Scumming forever on. And that&rsquo;s right. Yeah. I was using OneDrive to cloud save where the save files were going from Paradox.
Taylor
OK. All right, yeah.
Craig
For the game provider for Crusader Kings 3. And and I for some reason like I&rsquo;ve been using 2 OneDrive accounts and and anyway the the account that had all those saves linked to them wasn&rsquo;t syncing properly. Yeah, and by the time I sorted it. Out it it. Had lost those saves. So yeah, right back to like.
Taylor
And.
Craig
You know, two years ago, when I. Bought a game. So yeah, yeah, it does happen. It does.
Taylor
Happen. Well, actually, when we&rsquo;re talking about old tech, that reminds me of, I think it was around two or three months ago. Nintendo said that they have officially run out of Nintendo 3D.
Speaker
Alright.
Taylor
Yes, like repair kits, right? If you have a 3DS and you break anything on it up until now, up until about three months ago, you could have at least sent it back and they might have fixed it. Or you might have sent it to some sort of store, and that store might have got the parts and fixed it. But now they have. They&rsquo;re not making anymore.
Speaker
6.
Taylor
It&rsquo;s all gone. All of the reserves.
Speaker
See.
Craig
Are gone, you know, right to repair, right, right to repair.
Speaker 5
Yes.
Craig
All right. So the the next story. It&rsquo;s.
Taylor
Really a kalimba?
Craig
They&rsquo;re great. They&rsquo;re thumb piano. Yeah. Do you know how to play the kalimba?
Taylor
No, but I could probably pick it up in 5.
Craig
Then. Minutes alright. Well, you can be in charge. Of playing the. Tunes. Well, we&rsquo;re going from story to story. So OK, next story.
Speaker 7
OK, cool.
Craig
This is from Engadget Star Wars tales. The Star Wars tales of the Underworld will premiere on Fortnite beginning May 2nd, which blows my mind. So this.
Speaker 7
Shouldn&rsquo;t.
Taylor
You may the 4th.
Craig
Well, yeah, actually that that&rsquo;s a great point where the 4th is actually the holiday. Well, the the fake Star Wars holiday, may the fourth be with you. It&rsquo;s a bit of Star Wars news. So this is the new animated Star Wars series. And strangely, the first it&rsquo;s at least Episode 1 is premiering on the game platform. Or Fortnite? Right. So could you imagine going playing for and logging into Fortnite, then taking your character because it says that viewing will take place in the in game location called Star Wars Watch Party Island? You&rsquo;ve gotta go to this island, and then you&rsquo;ll you&rsquo;ll see a screen right on the island like a movie screen. What is? You&rsquo;ve got your character.
Taylor
OK. OK. Yeah. But it&rsquo;s not in game. Well, it is you. No. No, but it&rsquo;s not in a like a.
Craig
Oh, the fighting is switched off.
Taylor
Game, not the fighting switched off because I saw a as a singer. I don&rsquo;t particularly like.
Craig
Hey, please do it. You&rsquo;re in this. K pop.
Taylor
No tones and eye.
Craig
Tones an eye.
Taylor
Yeah. Who did the dance? It&rsquo;s one ohh, right? Yeah. She had a concert in Fortnite. Ohh, and you just basically load up into this screen and sort of like. There are all these visuals. There&rsquo;s like the video of it, and then suddenly you&rsquo;ll be, like transported down some sort of tunnel. And it&rsquo;s like, all with the musics going. And it&rsquo;s like a visualiser sort of effect sort of thing. So it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s still sort of like a a playable experience rather than just watching something.
Craig
And. Wow. And living in the future. Kind of vibe like, OK, so yeah, it&rsquo;d be interesting SMS. And now if you&rsquo;re planning to do it, OK, NEXT story.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
Musical interlude. That&rsquo;s quite good. Fallout creator says he was ordered to destroy source code that the studio has since lost. I had the I had had that in digital form and was ordered to destroy it. So this is a case. This is the file that created Tim Kaine and he was in an interview and he, he said. Yeah, this horrible thing happened and it&rsquo;s happened in, well, in terms of its standard practise, he said. In his experience working with a company where after you finished the job, they&rsquo;ll ask you to destroy all copies of the source code, right? And that they will then be the custodians and librarian guardian, guardian of the source code. Right. So it will be held. In the company, right, rather than the creator creator&rsquo;s hands. So he said this happened a couple of times where he&rsquo;s going to have destroyed everything as required, and then the company has lost it. Right. And he said he found this out because he. It was so this was like, years after he destroyed it. He goes. Where is it? You know? So then he says a few years later, after I had left the company, they contacted me and said, oops, we&rsquo;ve lost it. And I thought at first they were trapping me into into confessing that he&rsquo;d made a a legal error by keeping them. But he said no, no. I destroyed them like he told.
Speaker 7
Yeah.
Craig
And it turned out that they&rsquo;ve really lost them and they were hoping and they were hoping he hadn&rsquo;t done what he was legally required to do anyway. So he&rsquo;s saying, yeah, this is a problem because there are so many games out there in the 70s from the Seventies, 80s and 90s, that that source code is just gone because of mismanagement and.
Taylor
And we&rsquo;re panicking. Yeah. I wish well. Reminds me of Doctor Who. How?
Craig
Like white doctor episodes ago on the BBC, taped over.
Taylor
Fair enough. Yeah, fair enough. But also in terms of. How we&rsquo;re talking about how DS game, how DS has been. The DS NO3DS3DS is the one that has. They&rsquo;ve got no more parts for it. So don&rsquo;t they then have some sort of obligation to let it be emulated or is it just gonna go into the ether?
Speaker 4
What?
Craig
Yes, for prosperity.
Speaker 5
Great point.
Craig
Yeah. Yep. Yep. Well, emulate this SMS in now. Send us a message on the chat if you have, you know, the revolution starts here. Next story. Yep, you&rsquo;re doing well. It&rsquo;s beautiful. George Lucas here in the next story posted on Goose Mondo as well as a couple of other spaces. Anyway, article from.
Taylor
Gizmodo, saying you know The funny thing about that first of all is I&rsquo;ve always looked at that and it says very clearly. Gizmodo, Gizmodo.
Craig
It does too. I know Mondo Mondo is much better modo. Sorry go, Gaius Moto. Their headline is reveals why Yoda talks like that George Lucas does. Nice. Nice to see what they&rsquo;ve done there. The Star Wars creator recently settled a long standing question about the Jedi Master, so let&rsquo;s play the clip that this is part of. So here&rsquo;s George Lucas recently talking at. I think it&rsquo;s like a.
Taylor
Comic Con sort.
Craig
Of thing. It was, yeah, something like that, yeah.
Speaker
Why does Yoda speak backwards?
Speaker 5
Well, I will tell you, thank you. Yoda had a very distinctive way of talking because and it it was done purposely.
Speaker 4
Yeah, it&rsquo;s.
Speaker 5
Because if you were speaking regular English or being was he? People don&rsquo;t listen that much. But if he has an accent or it&rsquo;s really hard to understand what he&rsquo;s saying, they focus on what he&rsquo;s saying.
Speaker 4
Jedi Master Yoda, you seek Yoda.
Speaker
You know him?
Speaker 4
To him, alien.
Speaker 5
And what he was, he was basically the philosopher of the movie. So he was talking about all of the things, you know, in long talking scenes and stuff where I had to figure out a way to get people to actually listen, especially 12 year olds.
Craig
All right, so George Lucas&rsquo;s answer there in terms of why Yoda speaks kind of inverted is, so it will. Force people to listen to what you&rsquo;re saying because it&rsquo;s like what? So it&rsquo;s that kind of slow down and listen effect which what do you what do you think?
Speaker 7
Yeah.
Taylor
But should, but as as a as a movie maker, shouldn&rsquo;t everyone be listening to what your characters are saying all the time? You just make everyone speak like that.
Craig
Well, I mean we. That&rsquo;s great. I like that theory. If this is true. Well, I did. I did ask some leading theory.
Speaker 7
Yeah.
Craig
You know, so let&rsquo;s start with John first. John Fisk is one of my favourite cultural studies theorists. OK, he came up with the concept of cultural economy and textual poaching. So I asked techy PPT to say what John Fisk said about your distinctive speech patterns.
Taylor
Would have.
Craig
OK. So in terms of cultural economy theory, so this is a theory about how media creates hierarchies of meaning and value. Yoda&rsquo;s speech marked by inverted syntax. Immediately sets them apart from other characters, cause I guess no one else speaks in inverted syntax in styles.
Taylor
And 2D2.
Craig
Does who knows what syntax that is right beeps boops the so it immediately sets apart. I guess within the sassing. It&rsquo;s. I guess it could signal wisdom, mysticism, unconventional worldview, right. Because you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re like. Of inverted syntax so unconventional, his speech pattern functions as a form of cultural capital. Possibly right, because it distinguishes him as ancient, enlightened figure whose wisdom transcends conventional language structures.
Speaker
Yeah.
Craig
Right. I mean that or crazy person.
Taylor
Yeah, exactly.
Craig
Right. It goes on to say in the broader cultural economy of Star Wars, Yoda&rsquo;s speech reinforces his outsider status. Which I guess. He is an outsider. He&rsquo;s certainly the only do. Yeah.
Taylor
Little green, pointy eared. Goblin dude.
Craig
There aren&rsquo;t many others, no. He&rsquo;s not part of the dominant linguistic order of the Galaxy, much like how much? Yeah, that&rsquo;s right. Well, I&rsquo;m going to get around to that. Much like, how marginalised groups often develop unique linguistic styles to set them apart. Yeah, like, have you ever encountered any?
Taylor
American English is.
Craig
Unique linguistic styles in your experiences of subcultures bumping into groups of young hooligans. You know, with their own.
Taylor
Yeah. Well, I I guess, I guess what I disagree with there is that usually this sort of in culture, slang etcetera is used with other members of that species, whereas Yoda doesn&rsquo;t speak to anybody else that speaks like.
Craig
That, well, maybe his native tongue is back to France.
Speaker 5
Hmm.
Speaker
Hmm.
Craig
And then when he translates to speak English, he keeps that up.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
In terms of Fisks idea of textual poaching, so that&rsquo;s where, you know you&rsquo;ll parity or you&rsquo;ll you&rsquo;ll adopt bits of a franchise to call you put stickers of Fortnite on your laptop hasn&rsquo;t happened yet. Sexual poaching, right. It&rsquo;s a reinterpreted.
Taylor
Hasn&rsquo;t.
Craig
Each pen has been widely parodied, quoted, and adapted. By. Yeah. So I mean certainly in terms of if you want to do a voice like kind of gravely. Hmm.
Taylor
Brilliant.
Craig
That&rsquo;s pretty good. That was pretty good.
Speaker 7
Yes.
Craig
Voice as well as then talking in inverted syntax.
Taylor
You&rsquo;ve been practising that, haven&rsquo;t you?
Craig
Yeah, yeah, yeah. So yeah, a lot of lot of pop culture significance there. Well, I mean Halley&rsquo;s theory. Me. Yeah, I can keep beating on about this, he says pretty much the same thing. Well, actually, I did another search which was applying Blake Snyder&rsquo;s save the CAP framework to explain what your speech pattern means. And that was interesting because it did pick up moments of.
Taylor
Ohh yeah yeah yeah.
Craig
Where Yoda&rsquo;s mannerisms could be linked to a plot point so.
Speaker
M.
Craig
You know, the first one is the kind of the setup and theme, right? It&rsquo;s the argument there is that you&rsquo;re just speech immediately signals that he is different. So I guess if you&rsquo;re setting up the theme that in Empire Strikes Back, Luke Skywalker escapes from health, he goes to debate a train with the Jedi master doesn&rsquo;t know what Yoda looks like, but. Encounters this green pointy goblin, and because it&rsquo;s talking in inverted syntax, I guess it&rsquo;s setting it&rsquo;s a setup and theme establishment that it&rsquo;s. Different you&rsquo;re encountering difference as to whether or not that&rsquo;s ancient and wise difference. Looks like it doesn&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s the case with the first encounter. It then goes on to talk about the the second. Storytelling beat that can happen is the catalyst and debate beat. So in this way, it&rsquo;s so the catalyst is events that propel a hero into action. So when Luke Skywalker meets Yoda, he initially doubts that the small, strange creature is in fact wise, because he&rsquo;s talking in back, inverted syntax. So it&rsquo;s a catalyst, this moment aligns. With the debate. To Luke Skywalker is debating, you know, surely you&rsquo;re not Yoda. Do I trust Yoda or this green pointy goblin dude? And when the green pointy goblin says he is Yoda? Yeah. Do I trust him because his speech pattern does not seem to be wise. Bad guys close in, right and there to beat 3. This is interesting to me. Snyder&rsquo;s framework emphasises that obstacles should intensify the story as the story progresses. So as the story goes on, you get to act two and three. There should be more and more obstacles and they should be more intense. Yoda speech becomes more cryptic and challenging. It says as Luke struggles with his training, his unconventional syntax forces Luke and the audience to slow down and reflect. And this is what I guess George Lucas is saying about that decision. He wanted the audience to slow down and reflect. It&rsquo;s interesting that this is saying that. In terms of storytelling in universe, maybe what&rsquo;s happening here is Yoda is also getting looped to slow down and reflect by delivering his wisdom in inverted syntax. You reckon if you&rsquo;re a teacher you should invert syntax to help students slow down and reflect on the points you&rsquo;re making.
Speaker 7
This.
Speaker
No.
Taylor
Who&rsquo;s your favourite Star Wars character?
Craig
Ohh denga, he&rsquo;s the one that has toilet paper wrapped around him. He&rsquo;s one of the burning hunters in Empire Strikes Back. He was meant to be a key villain figure with Boba Fett in return to Jedi, but then they dropped that storyline in terms of it then.
Taylor
All right.
Craig
Team. Closing the yard vac with Darth Vader. But yeah, it&rsquo;s, I mean I choose that because it&rsquo;s such a weird, stupid decision. Say Dengar, but I always thought his action figure looked really cool and I was disappointed with how he was used in the movies because he basically is there. In one scene he doesn&rsquo;t say. Anything I don&rsquo;t think he does. Anything. Yeah, you can read my fan fiction. He&rsquo;s your favourite sales.
Taylor
Character. I probably don&rsquo;t have one now, but when? I. Was a kid, Mace Windu.
Craig
Do. Really. Yeah. You&rsquo;re doing the prequels? Yeah. You know, these windows? Cool. You know, Samuel Jackson can&rsquo;t know that. His. Yeah, I mean, he features heavily in a lot of the memes that come out of the Star Wars universe particularly.
Speaker 7
Yeah. But I I I liked him.
Taylor
His pre meme when I was a kid, I liked it because he had a purple lightsaber and.
Craig
Well.
Taylor
That was my favourite colour.
Craig
Was from what I remember, that was deliberately Jackson&rsquo;s choice. He asked for the purple lightsaber as a teacher. I mean, I mean, cause he&rsquo;s a teacher, right? He&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s training other padawans. Does he train? He certainly.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
Busts anakins balls, right. He&rsquo;s the one that says you can&rsquo;t become a paddle. You can&rsquo;t become a.
Taylor
I wouldn&rsquo;t put it like that, but yeah.
Craig
Master. Yeah, right. Yeah. You know, maybe that tough love that he&rsquo;s doing. Yeah. All right. Well, let&rsquo;s, let&rsquo;s. To answer new story, new story.
Taylor
Thing.
Craig
Oh, that&rsquo;s beautiful. Oh, OK yeah, yeah. No, that that was very helpful. Get them ready, screened to work. OK, so I want to go into Andor now. There&rsquo;s an article on Polygon talking how Andors creator isn&rsquo;t shy, but is inspiration for the Empire in Season 2 and basically it&rsquo;s linking it back to kind of it&rsquo;s Nazi symbology and the idea of a kind of right wing dictatorship. Nazi rise with a kind of nascent rebellion. Now, I don&rsquo;t want to talk about that. I want to talk about. An interesting interview with the three actors that play the the leading Imperial bad guys. So it&rsquo;s Ben Mendelson who plays, you know, one of the big Imperial. Honchos, I think is like the the the second in charge after Darth Vader for.
Taylor
I can&rsquo;t. I can&rsquo;t think of what it looks like.
Craig
You&rsquo;ve got Dennis Gove, who plays that kind of wimpy. Guy and and then the the, the. They&rsquo;re asked in this interview why are Star Wars villains British?
Taylor
OK.
Speaker
Pay attention.
Speaker 8
Now, is there anything you&rsquo;d care to tell me before I waste more of my time figuring out what it is you are up to?
Speaker 4
Near security violation will be brought to the Emperor&rsquo;s personal.
Speaker
Which?
Speaker 3
Of course, you&rsquo;re perfectly placed to answer this because you&rsquo;re respectively American, Australian and Irish, of course. So why is it so extraordinarily fitting that in this Star Wars universe that the really evil people are fitted with British accents?
Speaker 8
The Empire, darling, it just everything sounds a bit more evil when you do it in a very, very strong. English accent.
Craig
Just put it there. What do you think in terms of British accents and everything sounds more evil when you deliver it in an English accent.
Taylor
I like I can, I&rsquo;ve I&rsquo;ve seen that that they&rsquo;ve pretty much done that in a lot of the modern movies, but I kind of disagree. I think there&rsquo;s one more accent that does it a lot better.
Craig
Yeah, that&rsquo;s that. Ohh yeah. Yeah, yeah.
Taylor
South African. They&rsquo;re going back to Indiana Jones, going back to.
Craig
I mean. Yeah. OK. It&rsquo;s interesting that I was recently watching Gladiator too. Yeah, and that maps out like that. All the bad guys are British accents in terms of what Tatcha PTC&rsquo;s John Fisks interpretation of this being and cultural appearance. So again, cultural economy examines how media and cultural products shape or reflect social hierarchies. In Star Wars, the Galactic Empire is portrayed as an authoritarian regime like Nazis. And British accents often signal, well, not Nazis. But they&rsquo;re not against Nazis, but they signal power, control and the leaders. And I guess historically from them as a colonial power, you know, we&rsquo;re talking to the Dutch East India Company, the history of imperial colonialism in the. 17th, 18th and 19th century. So signals power control and elitism. Historically, Hollywood has used British accents to represent sophistication and intelligence, which aligns with the empire&rsquo;s structured, hierarchical nature. This plays into audience expectations. British accents evoke a sense of calculated. Any making the antagonist more imposing. So yes, if you want to short cut or shorthand, you know this is a bad guy. Bruce section well, Ben Mendelson, the Australian actor, offers a really, really I think different approach to this question a little later, but we&rsquo;ll listen to some further answers from the.
Taylor
OK.
Craig
Interview with the actors.
Speaker 8
Turn out the lights. Because I tried to do it in Irish initially when I got the scripts and I rang Tony and I was like this just is not gonna work. They&rsquo;re not gonna have an Irish woman in the empire. I&rsquo;m sorry. We just don&rsquo;t sound evil enough. And then we tried American and it didn&rsquo;t work. So we all fall back on.
Speaker 4
The British and there&rsquo;s a historical reason for it too. Yeah, we&rsquo;re talking about American films and, you know, the villain would be played by the heavyweight actors, and they tended to be. Rich and whatnot. So you had an English, you know, a you had your Vincent prices etcetera, etcetera. The lakes.
Speaker 1
Poems became black stack.
Speaker
The land withered is before a.
Speaker 4
Plague, you know, pushing, etcetera.
Speaker
Etcetera, we will.
Speaker 5
Deal with your rebel friends.
Speaker 4
Yeah. Ian McDiarmid? Yes, the mighty.
Speaker 8
Yeah, the mighty end.
Craig
So put it there. And an actor. What do you think so far? You know that you know, when early in Hollywood, I mean, not that. You are acting in the 19.
Taylor
Ellen. Hollywood. Yeah.
Craig
30s but I thought it was a really interesting point in terms of saying that they&rsquo;re often cast. You know, the villain royal needs a lot of heavy gravitas and hitter, so they&rsquo;ll, they&rsquo;ll cast someone, maybe with theatrical. Training right. Someone that comes from theatre, maybe an old school actor, which is inevitably going to be British. That kind of Shakespearean theatrical training. Yeah. Peter Cushing. I mean, Vincent Price isn&rsquo;t British, but nevertheless, he does affect the British accent and some of the horror.
Taylor
Yeah. Globe theatre. Yeah.
Craig
Films in McDermott anyway. The guy that plays the emperor. Because that theatrical Shakespearean training, do you reckon the villain role does require someone that that has better acting chops?
Taylor
I&rsquo;m not sure like if.
Craig
You&rsquo;ve got a bad actor doing a villain role. It&rsquo;s more likely to fall apart as a movie or an act theatre act than if the hero is a bad actor.
Speaker
Hmm.
Craig
Like does the the villain have to do all the heavy lifting in terms of makes the? You know the feeling can make the good guy look better, but it&rsquo;s hard for the if there&rsquo;s a bad actor as the villain. It&rsquo;s hard for the hero to make that bad actor look better as a villain. I know. I mean, I think like, well, I think like the Robin Hood, Prince of Thieves with that had.
Taylor
That&rsquo;s interesting, isn&rsquo;t it?
Craig
Robin Hood, Prince of Thieves that star it. Was.
Taylor
I mean, I mean all I can think of in terms of like having a big heavyweight as like the villain, the size of the lamb.
Craig
Yeah. Yeah, that&rsquo;s right. With. Oh, yeah, so OK.
Taylor
I can&rsquo;t remember his name.
Craig
1st.
Taylor
OK. Yeah. Prince of thieves. Let&rsquo;s go with that.
Craig
Vincent, because you had Kevin Costner. Hmm. And in fact, we&rsquo;re talking about accents. I was listening recently to a podcast that was saying how, when Kevin Costner first was on stage and performed his English accent because he&rsquo;s playing Robin Hood.
Speaker
Yes.
Craig
The director was so unimpressed with his English accent. Then he said you&rsquo;re just playing it as American. Just you&rsquo;re just playing the role with an American accent. But that was really stolen by Alan Rickman, who played the Sheriff of Nottingham, who really was seen to steal the movie as the villain again.
Speaker 5
Hmm.
Craig
Wonderful British accents. And that that seems to conform to that idea of, you know. You want your Bruce Willis playing off Halloween Rickman in die hard? I don&rsquo;t know. I mean, Alan Rickman&rsquo;s accent and die hard is kind of German English.
Taylor
Sort of thing. Yeah. Yeah. Well, when? When when I was most recently on stage. I didn&rsquo;t play the villain, but I played the comedy. Aspect.
Craig
Of it was Agatha. Yep.
Taylor
Agatha Christie played the comedy aspect of it. What sort of accent did I have? Welsh. Welsh.
Craig
How does it? Where does the Welsh accent go?
Taylor
Seasonal mists and mellow fruitfulness. Close bosom friend of the maturing sun.
Craig
That&rsquo;s perfect. We should do more voices. OK. So Ben Mendelson saying one of the things that made it more likely to have British accents was.
Taylor
Having a a seasoned actor, yeah.
Craig
Heavy headed. Yep. Let&rsquo;s hear how it goes.
Speaker
In time you will call me master.
Speaker 1
At last, we will reveal ourselves to the Jedi. At last we will have.
Speaker 4
Revenge. The Rebel alliance is too well equipped.
Speaker
Yes, my Lord, intensify the forward batteries. I don&rsquo;t want anything.
Speaker 4
To get through, where&rsquo;s my airway?
Speaker 8
It was easy last season to talk about the empires being Oh yeah, we want to be in the empire. It was kind of. There was a little bit of Campari to it anyway. Yeah, this. Season, that&rsquo;s all. Gone. It&rsquo;s really gone. It&rsquo;s not.
Speaker 1
Yeah, yeah.
Speaker
Company work? And then those are finished.
Speaker 8
I think Fiona doing her own accent as Cassian&rsquo;s mother was so inspired. It was so beautiful to have an Irish woman being the leader of that, like the start of his rebellion.
Speaker 7
People are standing up.
Speaker 8
It was. I felt very, very proud, but I&rsquo;m really enjoying, you know, mincing about as a terribly posh English person. What are you doing, Mr. Khan?
Speaker 5
Cassian and or as a murderer and a threat to the empire, I have been trying to.
Speaker 8
Find him and then Genevieve, obviously, is also Irish.
Speaker 9
The public. Although resentencing directive. Is the next step on an all too predictable March toward complete, unchallenged authority?
Craig
I&rsquo;m just reading ahead through some of the TPT props I did. Yeah, it&rsquo;s again going via Blake Snyder&rsquo;s save the cat, which is a kind of writing Bible that people some people use to write scripts for movies, breaking it apart in terms of the. Choice of accents in terms of why villains often have British. Since. He defines some of the reasons in terms of plot narrative, how I was just reading the the catalyst in debate moment. The catalyst is again the event that propels the hero into action in Star Wars. This is often the empires oppressive action again delivered in British accents, the British accented.
Speaker
M.
Craig
Villains create a clear ideological contrast between the empire and the rebellion. Rebellion particularly. I guess if the rebellion are speaking other accents. Like there we. That the fact that the some of the rebellion figures are Irish have have very strong Irish accents that the native Irish tongue or American accents. Snyder says that or that could be mirroring historical conflicts like the American Revolution, where British rule was resisted. So historically, yeah, there&rsquo;ll be moments in American history. Where they fought the British. Mm-hmm. American Revolution. So the British were the bad guys. That. In that struggle of of of independence.
Taylor
I mean that that does make sense like in terms of like historical things like that, but the people like for it to be so ingrained within our culture has to be something different.
Craig
Well, yeah. And I think I think part of it is that that the, the history of British cultural well British economic and cultural imperialism in the 17th, 18th, 19th centuries, you know, the the horrible, horrible history of American. Sorry, American. British imperialism into India or Australia that invasion. You know, it&rsquo;s part of that then also I do like the idea that part of it could also be them hiring, heavy hitting actors, actors that have that gravitas, Shakespearean, theatrically trained actors. So you&rsquo;ve got Alec Guinness, a good guy though, right? But very British accents. So actually it&rsquo;s a counter point to that, but maybe it&rsquo;s the the exception that proves the rule. Did you? Do you have any other feelings around accents in Star Wars the the use of British accents?
Taylor
Not really.
Craig
Yoda accents. No, you can&rsquo;t really. I mean, most Windows accent. Now that&rsquo;s an accent. That&rsquo;s American independence. That&rsquo;s. And particularly because he fights off against the emperor. That&rsquo;s Ian McDermott. I think the actors name is. Who&rsquo;s British and performing in Shakespearean British. Yeah. Yeah. So it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s, it is striking. You know, everything from certainly, you know, the Romans in, in any movie I watched Ben Hur over Easter, Lord of the Romans are theatrical British performance. Right. And they&rsquo;re all, like, chewing up the scenery with.
Taylor
Ohh my ohh.
Craig
The Shakespearean background.
Taylor
Yeah, same with Life of Brian.
Craig
Yes. Yeah. Are there any? Do they do any? Of them not speak. British they Polish English in that.
Taylor
I remember when I was a kid, right. And as a treat the teacher put on Ben Hur to.
Craig
Watch. OK Charlton Heston classic.
Taylor
The full Ben Hur across the whole day.
Craig
Is that 3 hours 3 plus hours?
Taylor
Three plus hours, plus the intermission it.
Craig
It&rsquo;s fantastic.
Taylor
The worst thing I&rsquo;ve ever sat.
Craig
Really. I mean. Ohh yeah yeah. I mean, if you&rsquo;re doing for school, anything&rsquo;s gonna suck. Yeah. I mean, unless there&rsquo;s some sexy scenes in it or something.
Taylor
But it was like a trait sort of thing and it just it went on for.
Craig
Well, yeah. But I mean I I quote it recently again introduced my daughter to it. She hadn&rsquo;t seen it, loved it. But I do.
Speaker 7
So long.
Craig
Think.
Taylor
You know that&rsquo;s a. Lie. Well, we.
Craig
Split it over 2 nights, right? So we, I mean, it really does have two bite sized films in it in terms of the first film, you forget.
Taylor
OK. Yeah. And then the chariot race, which goes on.
Speaker
Well, yeah, yeah.
Craig
Because I mean, the first film has the Climatic Third act of the the galley battle with the was it the Persian? I think first Roman galleys.
Taylor
For.
Craig
And and and that&rsquo;s pretty much where that ends. And then the second film, yeah, then has the huge chariot race, which I yeah, I think really holds up. I mean, sure, singing at school. I mean that&rsquo;s going to that&rsquo;s going to knock a lot of points off of its.
Taylor
Entertainment value. Actually. That reminds me. Do you remember back in? So it was in. I think it was 9 no 2002 between 2002 and 2006. Every DVD had that. You wouldn&rsquo;t steal a handbag, you wouldn&rsquo;t steal a car. Yeah.
Speaker
Oh.
Craig
Ohh yes yes, the anti piracy warning.
Taylor
Anti piracy warning interesting thing came out about that over the week. The this last week the font they used was pirated.
Craig
Alright, yes, it was the font. Let&rsquo;s try and remember it was the music. The font was pirated. Yeah, they didn&rsquo;t get permission. They didn&rsquo;t pay. And it&rsquo;s just this blatant hypocrisy, isn&rsquo;t it? I mean, you know what type of? I mean, I wonder if people that got well, you wouldn&rsquo;t get busted because of that ad, but nevertheless, it it does show you the hypocrisy behind and also the difficulty of navigating.
Speaker 7
Yeah.
Craig
That proprietary environment sometimes, yeah. And a media mothership. That&rsquo;s why we have the wonderful sounds of our kalimba kalimba. Kalimba action here on mother emoji. Yep. So we&rsquo;ll be releasing a CD. Probably by one. Yeah, I&rsquo;m thinking we&rsquo;re getting some great tunes coming in SMS. And now if you have any climber requests. Yeah, I&rsquo;ll do it. Mothership. So. I guess the other thing that I found interesting about that clip we just heard was when the actress the actress saying how proud she felt of hearing her native language, the native dialect, sorry, the the Irish dialect.
Speaker
Right.
Craig
Our accent being spoken in in stalls hand or have you ever felt an overwhelming sense of pride when you&rsquo;ve heard the Australian accents when you burst through in a movie?
Speaker 7
Christ. No. No, it&rsquo;s.
Craig
TV show.
Taylor
Like, it&rsquo;s really jarring every time it happens, isn&rsquo;t it? I mean, yeah.
Craig
Recently encountered A jarring experience.
Taylor
No, because I generally tend to stay away from it.
Craig
It is interesting when the Australian accent is nestled in a whole other, you know, smorgasbord of accents.
Speaker 7
Alright mate, really touches through.
Craig
I often find it plain. Yeah. And and often is quite quite a poor. Poor. Yeah, it doesn&rsquo;t. I mean, in terms of soft power, I guess what we&rsquo;re talking about here is the kind of attraction positiveness someone feels towards an ephemeral thing, like an accent. You know, the British accent has a lot of soft power as we&rsquo;re literally unpacking it here with Star Wars. We&rsquo;re saying, you know, why is British accent used for all these kind of reasons around villainry and power and menace that could convey authoritarian control. Right. That&rsquo;s a huge amount of soft power. It&rsquo;s not them physically being aggressive or sounding. You know, angry or powerful, but it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s just the power of the accent. The Australian accents. Yeah. Yeah. When, like, you got crocodile Dundee, crocodile hunter. So you might see that accent comes up as well. Yeah, a parody of that kind of Aussie, you know, outdoor.
Taylor
All Aussie adventures.
Craig
Rural, you know Bush kite, right? But that we&rsquo;ve been stuck with that since. Forever, right? It really is not at all part of the cultural imagining today. And you&rsquo;ve got various Australian actors, you know, Russell Crowe, thinking of Gladiator Ben Mendelson himself. We just heard from them, but they rarely, it seems, give a Hollywood movie performance in their. Stray and. Tonne.
Taylor
Oh yeah. I mean, that was his name, Thor. Fellow.
Craig
Chris Hemsworth. Yeah, yeah. Didn&rsquo;t perform Thor via Australian accent. Performed it via British accent, you know. Yeah.
Taylor
No British. Yeah, well.
Craig
Are there any superheroes that have us?
Taylor
Back onto Irish accents.
Craig
Yeah.
Taylor
Do you have like can you name an Irish movie?
Craig
I well, there&rsquo;s a really abominable well, not abominable, one of Sean Connery&rsquo;s first films is I feel it was cool, but it was it was it, he, he. He played an Irishman in, you know, 1920s island.
Taylor
OK. Yeah.
Craig
Yeah, well, an Irish film, yeah.
Taylor
I&rsquo;ve got one that you might like. OK, with your extensive experience in horror, genre comedy, sort of space grabbers.
Craig
Oh, let&rsquo;s do it. OK, grabbers. I&rsquo;ve not heard.
Taylor
Of it, it&rsquo;s an Irish made film, Irish starred film and it&rsquo;s all about. These. Creatures that. Are coming up from the sea and like birthing eggs on the beach and these eggs hatch and they start killing everybody, and then they figure out that the only way to.
Craig
Oh wow.
Taylor
Sort of be saved is to get blackout drunk and then when the creature tries to eat them, it gets poisoned by the.
Craig
Alcohol. Ohh. Really? Yeah. So this is the trailer. Very spooky sound effects. This came out in 20. 12. So he&rsquo;s been grabbed then?
Speaker
There&rsquo;s always a quiet places where the mad **** happens. For their pilot whales. They died at sea. Can&rsquo;t be self a sea monster.
Speaker 4
This is something totally different, something something alien.
Taylor
You don&rsquo;t believe me?
Speaker
None of this. Yes.
Speaker 7
Christ, it&rsquo;s a nice.
Speaker
Evil incidences.
Speaker 8
Alrighty.
Speaker 4

Speaker 8
Just a goodbye party. Whatever.
Speaker
She&rsquo;s right at. The door. There&rsquo;s none. Have you got some tags? On you not on me, no.
Craig
It does remind me a bit of, you know, the real world phenomena of where you find something you think is actually bad for you is good for you. So, right. So like, you know, bit of red wine actually some of that each week is good for you. Coffee, you know, doesn&rsquo;t that have wow and this week?
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
Be good for you. So it does. I think it does play into that as well as what a delightful idea. Grandmas came out in 2012. How did you?
Taylor
Come across that so the way that I came across that is so the police officer, the female police officer that you see in. There.
Craig
Yeah, and wonderful Irish accents.
Taylor
Yes. Ohh, I forgot what her name is, but she&rsquo;s in the Doctor Who audios where she plays Molly O&rsquo;Sullivan and so.
Craig
Ah. Is that a companion or?

Which doctor? What is it 9? No 8th Doctor Who? The movie.
Craig

Craig
To do that. Wonderful. Alright well. So anyway, so that&rsquo;s how you came across it. You then did a search of the.
Taylor
Yeah, because because I I was like trying to figure out who this woman was. And oh, she&rsquo;s in a movie. So it was the first movie I bought on. ITunes actually was that.

<p><strong>Episode 104 &ndash; With host Craig Norris and Taylor Lidstone and special guest Evelyn Lambeth</strong></p>



<p>How do historical perceptions of pigs shape modern food safety in Australia? We talk with PhD candidate Evelyn Lambeth about the fascinating world of pigs and pork in Australia. Drawing upon her current thesis research, &ldquo;Pork Problems: Cultural Attitudes Toward Pigs Through History and Their Effects on Modern Food Safety in Australia,&rdquo; Evelyn uncovers the rich historical context and colonial influences that have shaped our perceptions of these remarkable animals.</p>



<p>Join us as we explore the cultural and economic ramifications of pork consumption, the intricate web of environmental and public health considerations, and the research methodologies that bring this intriguing topic to life. Whether you&rsquo;re a foodie, a history buff, or simply curious about the intersections of culture and food safety, this episode is packed with insights that will change the way you think about pigs and pork.</p>

   Craig Norris
Alright, you&rsquo;re listening to media mothership on 99.3 FM and it looks like everything&rsquo;s green lit now. So I&rsquo;ve taken control of the station for the next 50 minutes. I&rsquo;m Craig who will be. The host of. The show, as I&rsquo;ve been for the last 103 episodes, joined by my co-host Taylor Hello and special guest all the way from UTAS.
Taylor Lidstone
All the way from upstairs.
Speaker
Sandy, baby.
Craig Norris
PhD candidate from the School of Humanities Major in history, Evelyn Lambeth. Hello. Hello fantastic. So where? So I did grab Evelyn so I could. Unleash her research onto the Hobart airwaves through Edge radio as well as we&rsquo;re streaming on YouTube and Twitch so you can jump on that Twitch if you want to see us live in person by just going to media mothership and we&rsquo;re going to explore her. Research that&rsquo;s in its third year looking at issues around well. Pigs. I&rsquo;ve. I&rsquo;ve written your title somewhere. Yes, no, somewhere but. But you&rsquo;re here in the flesh for me. To. For you to tell our audience what your project is. What&rsquo;s the title of your thesis or your research at the moment?
Evelyn Lambeth
The title of my thesis as it stands. I can change it later if I want. We&rsquo;ll see how we go. It&rsquo;s called pork problems. Cultural attitudes towards pigs through history and the effects on modern food safety in Australia.
Craig Norris
So it&rsquo;s as you&rsquo;re within the area of history, it&rsquo;s taking a very broad long historical view of. The controversially titled Pork Problems, so it&rsquo;s already kind of, I guess, flagging concerns some some more than likely, myths that that I have, that you have, Taylor. That probably a lot of people in the audience. Do you eat pork a little bit? Yeah. I eat pork, everyone.
Evelyn Lambeth
Do eat pork? I do.
Speaker
Yeah.
Craig Norris
The first thing to say, and it&rsquo;s just. My own curiosity. About the naming of English, how English names things. So we&rsquo;ve got. Eggs. And then we&rsquo;ve got pork. Now it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s the. It&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s the connection between pigs and pork? Why do we? Call it pork. And not something like pig meat or.
Evelyn Lambeth
How appetising pig meat sound to you? Do you want to get some pig meat?
Craig Norris
From the store like. In fact, yeah. Is this? Historical curiosity, So what? What&rsquo;s because I know that. I mean, for me, one of the surprising things about animals has been that moment where England was was at the the 1066 invasion of Normandy, and suddenly all these French words ended up. So you&rsquo;ve got mutton and beef and and this kind of historical curiosity of the language used to mean the. Did that happen with pigs? And pork.
Evelyn Lambeth
Absolutely. There&rsquo;s lots of theorists that go into this. Probably 1 of the more famous ones be Carol Adams, but she talks about it as the absent referent, so the just removing yourself from the animal makes it feel more holistic to eat. You feel further removed from the animal if you say I&rsquo;m eating bacon versus I&rsquo;m eating a backstrap. Off of this cute little pig.
Craig Norris
Yes, and that OK, so let&rsquo;s open up a couple of things. But the first thing, this historical curiosity, so much like my weirdness about why we name the thing, we&rsquo;re eating something else. Have you come across any surprising historical facts as you&rsquo;ve been researching pigs in? Australia, that&rsquo;s the. Top five surprises, Top 10 surprises Top 25 surprises.
Evelyn Lambeth
10. Wow. Yeah, my. Yeah, I think about pigs all the time. Maybe I&rsquo;m interested in the legacy of pigs. I I studied. I hope you can tell from my accent I&rsquo;m an immigrant. I was born in Louisiana, so when I immigrated about 8 years ago. Obviously I was really interested in why Australians don&rsquo;t really eat kangaroo or wallaby. In my mind that would be a really good source of protein, so of course I wrote my thesis about that. My undergraduate thesis about that.
Craig Norris
No. Why don&rsquo;t we eat? I&rsquo;m sorry. I&rsquo;m really curious now. Why? Why don&rsquo;t I eat them?
Speaker
Ah.
Taylor Lidstone
Have you ever eaten?
Craig Norris
Them. Yeah, I went to a really expensive restaurant once and they served. Kangaroo I reckon I blocked it out man.
Taylor Lidstone
You can get you. Can get ruberg as at just.
Craig Norris
Woolworth yeah. They they don&rsquo;t though, I mean. Yeah. What&rsquo;s going on there?
Evelyn Lambeth
I argued I wrote a paper about it. It&rsquo;s published in Gastronomica if you want it. And there&rsquo;s a podcast version of IT, Heritage Radio Network.
Craig Norris
Gastronomica great name for a journal. Really. Gastronomica Heritage Radio Network check it.
Evelyn Lambeth
Out check it out, but my argument is that. It&rsquo;s an emblem animal, so it was marketed out of our conscious ability to eat.
Craig Norris
It by implants that like.
Taylor Lidstone
Ah, that&rsquo;s why Americans don&rsquo;t eat eagles.
Craig Norris
So there&rsquo;s more reasons than that. There&rsquo;s like, not much meat on it and.
Evelyn Lambeth
But of course, there&rsquo;s policy and game law and lots of mechanisms that protect certain animals for consumption. I eat beef and mutton in.
Taylor Lidstone
Yeah.
Evelyn Lambeth
Australia is it because?
Craig Norris
It&rsquo;s like we have our coat of arms emblem, so there&rsquo;s literally an emblem that features. Our animals I don&rsquo;t need. I don&rsquo;t need anything that&rsquo;s on our emblem either. Yeah, but it seems like the squandering of resources, right? It does end up in in a food chain. I imagine in terms of animal cat food, right? Dog food. That&rsquo;s where it ends up in this lower food chain.
Evelyn Lambeth
Absolutely. And yeah, a little bit and the human consumption market and we export. It as well.
Craig Norris
So is there a human export market for us? Right, who eats its overseas?
Evelyn Lambeth
Lots of Southeast Asian countries, we ship a lot of bones there as well.
Craig Norris
And that would promote, right? Ohh, right. And there&rsquo;d be all this language around the nutritional benefits that this is great food. So it&rsquo;s interesting. Yeah. The domestic market isn&rsquo;t engaged with it as.
Evelyn Lambeth
Tenuous California.
Taylor Lidstone
Well, so we ship bones is that for like making stocks and stuff like that? OK, yeah.
Craig Norris
Do you eat native animals?
Evelyn Lambeth
Yeah, I think everyone. I think the best way forward, honestly, there&rsquo;s no right or wrong and it&rsquo;s going to be a multifaceted way forward. But you should eat according to the land. I think everyone should be sanitarians.
Taylor Lidstone
Koalas.
Craig Norris
Ohh, that&rsquo;s kangta areans do I love that phrase? While Italians Kington, you got vegetarians.
Evelyn Lambeth
I did not. Coin that turn, but I don&rsquo;t know who. Did, but it&rsquo;s a good one.
Craig Norris
That&rsquo;s the only atarian I know. I love the idea of Kanga Terrians.
Evelyn Lambeth
Yeah, it&rsquo;s not univariance omnivores.
Craig Norris
I&rsquo;m divorce. Yeah. That&rsquo;s mind blowing. All right, so you started. That was your. Honest thesis was. It or or a previous paper research.
Evelyn Lambeth
Oh yeah, that was my honours thesis. Oh, we&rsquo;re still talking about the pig. Gosh.
Craig Norris
We&rsquo;re getting around to the pig. You just blew my mind in terms of posing a question that I&rsquo;ve not asked myself, and I gotta admit part, it would be psychological. Just feeling like, you know, I&rsquo;m such. A creature of. Habit that I&rsquo;m just eating my cow. And the pig and to see like it has to be on sale, it has to be pretty heavily discounted and thinking OK, well that&rsquo;s a good value thing. It&rsquo;s fascinating cause there&rsquo;s Wallabies. There&rsquo;s yeah. Anyway, so surprising. Historical facts. OK. Oh, here we go. So the next. So in that case, if we&rsquo;re looking at changes to people&rsquo;s attitudes towards me, that&rsquo;s an example, I guess of of Australian attitudes towards indigenous. Animals. That, that, that are not changing. Your the title is. What is it, pork? Problems. Alright, so there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s attitude issues towards Paul. What&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s the history of that? What what is that? That poor problem over time issue you&rsquo;re unpacking?
Evelyn Lambeth
Yeah, so studying. Native animal. I then wanted to look at a domesticated species. And I sort of compared Wallaby and. Cow consumption. So I knew a lot about the beef industry, but less about pigs, so they seemed a natural. Choice and like I guess going back to facts that are surprising. Some of the statistics argue that we have close to 23.5 million wild pigs in Australia. So yeah, almost more pigs than humans. And yet if you asked the average Australian if they eat pork, they&rsquo;d probably say.
Speaker
Really. Wow.
Evelyn Lambeth
No.
Craig Norris
So, so OK, first point is I guess there&rsquo;s a lot of well, pigs and those, those are wild pigs, right? Are we talking like tusks and fur, like, these are back?
Evelyn Lambeth
It depends how long they&rsquo;ve been in the wild. Picture really interesting. They&rsquo;re really adaptable. Of course, they&rsquo;re very destructive. To, especially to.
Craig Norris
Because they&rsquo;re truffle finders. That&rsquo;s all right. They get their snout and everything, and they&rsquo;ll just root around, which is great for, like, finding truffles, but pretty damaging for, you know. For and for.
Evelyn Lambeth
Fragile ecosystem.
Taylor Lidstone
And they like eating everything, don&rsquo;t they? Pretty much, yeah.
Evelyn Lambeth
They do. They&rsquo;re omnivores. They did everything. But they. Yeah, really adaptable so. All the wild pigs in Australia obviously were escaped from domestic pigs because they are not native to this.
Craig Norris
Would have been and they came here on.
Evelyn Lambeth
The ships the ships pick a ship. Any ship.
Speaker
Right.
Craig Norris
Asian all ships have them on them.
Evelyn Lambeth
Yeah, whether they&rsquo;re in barrels or whether they&rsquo;re running around.
Craig Norris
That&rsquo;s right. How many? Anyway, the colonial time we&rsquo;re talking the, the, the, the, the, the, the English invasion. Colonisation of Australia, part of the the species, they&rsquo;re going to introduce. Into Australia, where pigs.
Evelyn Lambeth
Absolutely. Arguably, before that too, you had French, Dutch, Chinese merchant ships. We had pigs earlier, but I chose to start with the Captain cookers, which is what the pigs were called, really. Had a really.
Craig Norris
Right.
Evelyn Lambeth
Prolific habit of like leaving pigs to breed wherever he left so that he could come.
Craig Norris
Back and have food. And are they one of the species that&rsquo;s able to do that really easily? Like if you just leave a couple of pigs there and then you come back on your next voyage in a few years time, you&rsquo;ll have, you know, a a decent pig population that you&rsquo;re gonna be. Able to harvest and.
Evelyn Lambeth
Absolutely adaptable and they&rsquo;re extremely what&rsquo;s the word?
Speaker
Really.
Craig Norris
Fertile is that unusual in introduced species to some species like not become fertile like as soon as like pandas. Yeah, OK horses right. I imagine like, I mean, yeah, the Chinese colonialism and operation never existed. Well, in terms of the British East India level, it would be funny if they were trying to introduce.
Taylor Lidstone
Pandas.
Craig Norris
And it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s part of their food source space, it&rsquo;s. Tangent, but yeah, in terms of what what I mean, you got chickens, you got your pigs, you got your cows. I mean pigs, though. Have you found that pigs are particularly good at kind of living somewhere and.
Evelyn Lambeth
They are particularly good, of course, it&rsquo;s contingent on many things. The ecosystem, you know, temperature. We think of the pig, but they&rsquo;re before the species of pig brought to Australia was a very specific pig, that was.
Craig Norris
What date is that? That&rsquo;s the 18 Australian history my history teacher hates me now. Did you how old? When did the Captain Cook?
Taylor Lidstone
Where&rsquo;d you get me? I don&rsquo;t know anything.
Craig Norris
You&rsquo;ve got your phone there. Touch your PT, bro. When did Captain Cook come to Australia? My American guest to.
Evelyn Lambeth
Sail the ocean sea. Oh, wait, that&rsquo;s Columbus 1788.
Craig Norris
1788, so pretty much from 1788 on we had the British ones. As you&rsquo;ve seen before, Dutch French colonises had been also doing Spanish, have been doing the same thing so. Yeah, there&rsquo;s various fluctuations, but pretty much, yeah, that that was introduced then 17.
Evelyn Lambeth
88 that was introduced then, and the breed was specific to a Chinese breed, actually. The history of the East India Company and trade with China is really specific, but the the port where they were trading pigs, they wanted pigs that could fatten more quickly because the wild pig is very lean.
Craig Norris
Right. So previous to that you had a A European British pig that was. Like a a ball or something like it was like fairy long legs or something and.
Evelyn Lambeth
Furry, far from the ground. Yeah, I tusks. They subsisted mostly on, like pannage. They would just broom wherever they go, eat nuts, acorns they were. Their value is and their ability to feed themselves.
Craig Norris
Yeah. Yeah. And so here we have a case of that that industry wanting. To genetically breed what they wanted, right? Which was what? More meat? Something that would have more. Meat on it. Would be less intelligent.
Evelyn Lambeth
More fat, actually. The fat. They liked. The lard. The lard was useful. Yeah. To make things like candles. And you.
Speaker
Or.
Craig Norris
Chance. Right.
Evelyn Lambeth
They were using every part of the pig quite literally.
Craig Norris
Yeah. So you were showing me the what was the website called the the?
Evelyn Lambeth
Everything but the oink.
Craig Norris
Everything about the ice, so everyone check that out. Everything but the oink and it&rsquo;s going into this idea of how use how how we make use of animals and there&rsquo;s some fantastic information about pigs on there. And that that&rsquo;s been baked into the pig. Or human engagement with the pig early on right that that genetically getting this Chinese what&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s the story about the Chinese pigs? So they, how did they get arrive at that being the best pig?
Evelyn Lambeth
I. Sorry, just so I understand your question, you&rsquo;re asking how the English got to that specific breed or?
Craig Norris
Yeah. So you had the well, I guess the greater was the East Asia.
Evelyn Lambeth
How the Chinese got that?
Craig Norris
Trading company. And how did they find the Chinese pig? What was that history of colonisation?
Evelyn Lambeth
That. Big and broad, the pig is actually from a really specific region called the Guangdong region, and it&rsquo;s was based on a period of trade for 60 years. Because most of the other ports were closed, there was a war. There&rsquo;s yeah, the opium Wars, different sort of things that affected.
Craig Norris
Yeah, right.
Evelyn Lambeth
Which species we&rsquo;re allowed to leave based on who is allowed access to whatever given Yep region but.
Craig Norris
Then they found this pig. They&rsquo;re gone.
Evelyn Lambeth
Yeah, they found the pig, and Chinese pigs had been. Yeah. Chinese pigs had been.
Craig Norris
And is it like the pig that? We know like it&rsquo;s the pig, it&rsquo;s the pink.
Evelyn Lambeth
Much bigger, smaller to the ground they&rsquo;ve been cohabitating with them for much longer than European civilizations.
Craig Norris
Ryan. Wow. And so that&rsquo;s the pig that then became this. You know, colonising force along with the European powers, and that&rsquo;s the one that&rsquo;s that was then introduced into Australia. So many of the wild pigs are that.
Evelyn Lambeth
Time, and particularly British pigs, bad the. Dutch have their own breeds of pig. The French have their own breeds of pig, so other breeds of pig out there. But the one that is prolific in Australia was the British Chinese mix.
Speaker
So.
Craig Norris
This kind of cultural shift, what&rsquo;s the cultural shift around our attitudes towards poor consumption then? Like I mean, I feel it&rsquo;s always been part of my diet, but is that historically has historically been the case? I mean it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s being used as a, as a kind of handy resource for, for fats and meat. It seems like the attitude been positive in terms of its exploitability, but am I missing something here?
Evelyn Lambeth
Yeah, that&rsquo;s part of what made this research quite difficult. As an historian, my methodology, I deal with a lot of archives. I read a lot and. Where you find pigs in the literature. They&rsquo;re often combined with livestock, whereas like mutton or beef or Countess or cows and sheep are counted individually. It&rsquo;s much less the case with pigs. You do get some statistical analysis of them. But it forced me to then think through like, well, who&rsquo;s eating the pigs if we&rsquo;re not exporting them? Because Australia really, when it was a colony. All of the money came into gold. Wheat and then eventually mutton wants refrigeration and things came out for export commodities and so.
Craig Norris
Not, and that&rsquo;s cheap. I see I struggle with. Words. It&rsquo;s like.
Evelyn Lambeth
Ohh, sheep and mutton. They are different. Lamb. Yeah, it&rsquo;s because I. Didn&rsquo;t grow up with sheep.
Craig Norris
That&rsquo;s alright. No lamb, lamb is mutton. Right. And sheep is what sheep is.
Speaker
Plasma.
Craig Norris
Lamb is lamb is lamb. Yeah, no man English.
Evelyn Lambeth
The woolly sheep, right?
Craig Norris
And and and so yes, the in terms of the romanticism, I guess around food stock or livestock like sheep will really like Australia was living off the sheep&rsquo;s back. I think it&rsquo;s the phrase like it was A and the whole romance around sheep shearers. And then you&rsquo;ve got drovers for. Cattle and they&rsquo;re kind of Cowboys. So you&rsquo;ve got these romantic associations of attitude towards these livestock animals. Yeah. Pigs are there as well in Australia, but they don&rsquo;t have any romance like saying you&rsquo;re a farmer for pig is like, well, I haven&rsquo;t seen the man from Snow. A pig place. And it doesn&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m trying I mean.
Evelyn Lambeth
Absolutely clear. But so just.
Craig Norris
Until babe, until. Babe. Yeah, my.
Taylor Lidstone
What is it? My grandfather&rsquo;s brother is in, babe.
Evelyn Lambeth
Wait, your grandfather&rsquo;s brother, your great uncle?
Craig Norris
To see.
Taylor Lidstone
My great. Uncle. Yeah. Wow.
Craig Norris
Wow.
Taylor Lidstone
And he&rsquo;s the bad. Guy, really.
Speaker
What&rsquo;s?
Craig Norris
He&rsquo;s the pig. Ohh yeah. Because it&rsquo;s interesting, isn&rsquo;t. I mean, in terms of media representations, trying to think of attitudes towards animals and pigs in. Ridiculous, I guess. While I can talk about it as as it&rsquo;s always been there in the supermarket and I&rsquo;ve not felt any real, you know, kind of reluctance in terms of choosing it over, you know, well much more easily than than kangaroo. Nevertheless, yeah, there are negative associations towards the type of cleanliness of a pig and the type of. Industry around it, right? It&rsquo;s not considered glamorous. In terms of the past history like Human Snow River with cattle. And your shearers like there&rsquo;s a couple of Australian movies that are all about sheep sharing. So. So is this is this also part of, I mean, the struggle that attitudes have towards pigs, they&rsquo;re just.
Evelyn Lambeth
Yeah, there&rsquo;s a large taboo list, almost a demonising of them as a species, but historically, like if you read the convict documents about why people were shipped to Australia. Oftentimes it was for pig stealing, like people would be sentenced for life or pigs stealing. They were in Britain, and so they get here and they&rsquo;re raising pigs again in the prisons.
Craig Norris
In Britain. Right. And there was a lot of pigs stealing in Britain because there were animals that could be grabbed reasonably easily, I imagine, right. They&rsquo;re not going to. They&rsquo;re gonna be in pens.
Evelyn Lambeth
Not really at that point in the early to mid 19th century, there&rsquo;s a lot of starving big mass movements into urban areas. Pigs can have anywhere from 11 to 18 piglets per litter. So when they&rsquo;re babies they run, they run wild. You could just like let a pig fatten itself up and then ****** one off the street and bring it.
Craig Norris
Right.
Evelyn Lambeth
To market, all right. But. You know, domesticated animals are property, so if.
Craig Norris
Someone they&rsquo;d be branding or something going on and OK, so right. So there&rsquo;d be a lot of convicts or some convicts would have been brought down here to Australia. Van Demons land, even in, like, Port Arthur, we&rsquo;d have some pig.
Evelyn Lambeth
Or hearsay. Ohh yeah, pig pans. Yeah, yeah. So they made a lot of shoes in Port Arthur and Ben, Demons Land and pigskin pigskin would be the.
Taylor Lidstone
Action.
Craig Norris
Pictures.
Speaker
Why?
Evelyn Lambeth
In the back of the shoe or that soft bed is pig.
Craig Norris
Leather. Great. So quite a nice so that leather can be used and that&rsquo;s going out of style, right. There&rsquo;s not. Pig leather is not really a. Thing anymore? Oh, it&rsquo;s still it is.
Evelyn Lambeth
A thing? Yeah.
Craig Norris
Where can I get it?
Evelyn Lambeth
It&rsquo;s really soft and and historically wasn&rsquo;t used as much as other Leathers because if you think about toothbrushes, for instance, the bristles, that&rsquo;s about how thick a bore hair is, right? So big bristles were historically used in toothbrushes. The holes in the skin are quite porous.
Craig Norris
Right. So toothbrushes used the bristles from all their bristles were from. Boards and boards.
Evelyn Lambeth
Yeah, I mean, camels too. There were other species used, but they&rsquo;re ones.
Speaker
Really.
Taylor Lidstone
Snake.
Evelyn Lambeth
Snake. No. Snakes don&rsquo;t have fur. Not that I know. Maybe.
Craig Norris
Hey. They do. You and your snake interests. Erase me.
Evelyn Lambeth
Yeah, yeah. Interesting though there is an operation, pig bristle. I&rsquo;m sorry. Yeah, it was operation Pig bristle after World War 2:00 we we also used them in paint brushes. But after World War 2, when the soldier settler scheme was happening the second the second one soldiers would get homes and farms, they really went into the dairy industry to try and cultivate a market after the war. But we didn&rsquo;t have any paint brushes because they&rsquo;re also used to paint the war machine. So like US, imports of paint brushes were wild Australian imports. So we ran out and we like literally forced our way into Hong Kong into chunking to go and get pig bristles.
Craig Norris
Wow the. Need to secure that. Resource resulted in a military operation.
Evelyn Lambeth
Exactly. And I think it goes to show how diverse pigs are. The pigs in Australia were domesticated to the point that they didn&rsquo;t grow bristles that were useful for. Kind of operation they were intended for.
Craig Norris
That&rsquo;s crazy. That&rsquo;s one of those kind of scientific. Butterfly effects, something rippling to have causal effects on something else that you&rsquo;d not at all imagine. That right. OK. So so the use of that&rsquo;s no longer the case. I imagine there&rsquo;s like plastic bristles that we use.
Evelyn Lambeth
Once nylon came into the mix, you had more nylon bristles. But pig bristles are definitely still used a lot of times in shaving brushes because they&rsquo;re.
Craig Norris
Soft. Yeah, right.
Evelyn Lambeth
Badger brushes badger fur is still really useful. Yeah, another interesting. A side that was uh. Related to Captain Cookers, so when he would just leave pigs all over the place, he left someone on Auckland Island and that&rsquo;s in New Zealand, not Australia. Still the same species of pig, but the difference was on Auckland Island. It&rsquo;s the humans that live on Auckland Island. It&rsquo;s just a really rugged, a lot of different animals, native animals. But the pigs are really destructive on that island, but they&rsquo;ve also adapted to be like a really robust, you know, it&rsquo;s heart conditions there. But in the we use a lot of pig insulin for diabetes, diabetes, treating. And in the 60s. And. You know, globalisation had been a thing for a long time by that point, but the there was a mutation in the genetics of insulin around the world. And because, you know, we crossbred and pure bred, so many things, most of the pigs around the world had this genetic mutation. So we couldn&rsquo;t use the insulin in humans, but not Gland island. There was this whole strategy. Like we got to kill the pests. But then a scientist was like, oh, let&rsquo;s just check them. Let&rsquo;s, like, let&rsquo;s quarantine 1 and see what happens. And it was the only insulin that we could use for humans at the time. And when? For being a pest species to a $300,000 sale. Tonight.
Craig Norris
Isn&rsquo;t that fascinating that suddenly it can turn so dramatically as the opposite, right, the the this, this waste kind of pest species suddenly turned to thank goodness we didn&rsquo;t extra eradicate them? Wow. That that&rsquo;s so this this was only recently recently recently in history. That, that, that.
Evelyn Lambeth
Yeah, they&rsquo;re still there. Wow. Yeah. It&rsquo;s just really expensive to quarantine them. Yeah, they&rsquo;re big animals, yeah.
Craig Norris
So you were talking there about I guess earlier on the the role that colonialism played in in shaping our perception of pigs. But I guess as a resource, a thing to be exploited, is that still the case today? Is there still that same? Kind of British colonial attitude towards this is simply a resource. Or has that changed or are we still, you know, basically perpetuating these British colonial myths?
Evelyn Lambeth
Yes, I would say it&rsquo;s gotten worse. Yeah. Prophet.
Craig Norris
See, I just have this view of history always being better. Thank you. OK, so that might be, but I was kind of expecting. Yeah. No, no, no. The industry has cleaned itself up. It&rsquo;s really good. But no, there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s still some. OK, let&rsquo;s break it.
Evelyn Lambeth
Down. Let&rsquo;s break it down. I think more than anything. Globalisation has. Commodified animals, even more trying to find the the baseline to make things as cost effective. Australia still imports 60% of its pork from Denmark and the US mostly. And so I guess what I&rsquo;ve trying to get people to look at in my research is it doesn&rsquo;t matter. It does matter what happens in Australia with pigs, but it also matters how pigs enter the country and what form, and then also the conditions where the pigs are raised, where they&rsquo;re coming from, still complicit some of those conditions are horrific. Conditions here are also horrific, but. Yeah, I guess we&rsquo;re beef and wheat are I was thinking about this when I was riding today. If we lost the cow, the kangaroo or the pig and the social imaginary Australia, like which one would be missed the most? Yeah. Do you have?
Craig Norris
An answer ah, it&rsquo;s interesting because you can see the reality of it. The mad cow disease strikes and suddenly beef is completely eradicated. So the question was, which of the what was? It it was.
Evelyn Lambeth
The cow, the pig and the wall of beer kangaroo.
Craig Norris
OK, which one would be the most devastating in terms of our cultural imaginary and sense of quality of life?
Evelyn Lambeth
Economic well being.
Craig Norris
Well, yeah, the cow, right. Because where&rsquo;s my neck is? Big Mac, you know. I mean it just that would be the obvious.
Evelyn Lambeth
All do Australians do have to. Abbreviate everything.
Craig Norris
It&rsquo;s not McDonald&rsquo;s maccas, it&rsquo;s a bikie. It&rsquo;s not a biker, you know. And yeah.
Evelyn Lambeth
Nice.
Taylor Lidstone
Is there any reason why chicken wasn&rsquo;t on that list? Because I would say that&rsquo;s probably all the people that I. Know. Mostly eat chicken compared to everything else.
Craig Norris
Yeah, the crisis with eggs at the moment.
Evelyn Lambeth
That&rsquo;s a. That&rsquo;s just because it&rsquo;s my own fault. I just made the question up myself. Maybe it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m, like, aware that there&rsquo;s a chicken.
Taylor Lidstone
OK.
Evelyn Lambeth
Shortage. Yeah, tickets are interesting, but the so if you go to like Kangaroo Island on the southwest or southeast of Australia. The breeds that we consume the flesh of are not the same breeds that we consume the eggs of. So the once we consume the eggs of have a life and then they&rsquo;re cold, they&rsquo;re meats wasted. There&rsquo;s different boiler chickens that are raised for food consumption, yeah.
Taylor Lidstone
And that&rsquo;s on Kangaroo Island. So is there like Kangaroos on Chicken Island then? Ohh jeez.
Evelyn Lambeth
Yeah. To be honest, there&rsquo;s Pig island. Yeah. If you follow the pig, it&rsquo;s really good. But there&rsquo;s a Big Island. Yeah.
Craig Norris
All right, so there, there. She misses as a little pigs.
Evelyn Lambeth
Yeah. Yeah. It&rsquo;s in the Pacific islands, and it has a lot of pigs.
Craig Norris
And it&rsquo;s one of.
Evelyn Lambeth
Really. Really.
Craig Norris
It&rsquo;s been bequeathed. It&rsquo;s one of those those little lions that was bequeathed a lot of pigs as a key stop off point for the Spanish and the French and the.
Evelyn Lambeth
British eating all your turtles you could.
Craig Norris
Turtle. Yeah. What is it about turtles being the most delicious flesh ever that&rsquo;s been eaten? I&rsquo;ve heard that story said and.
Evelyn Lambeth
Well, I think if you were starving on a ship for six months, anything would be delicious.
Craig Norris
Yeah, I think it would be. Basically, it&rsquo;s crazy. Yeah, it was an IQ. Stephen Fry was talking about how. Yeah, turtle, they they had to prohibit and they were trying to bring them back for scientific curiosities. But they&rsquo;d be eaten by the time. They kept there by the crew and.
Taylor Lidstone
Have you ever heard of that? That French dish, which is said to be the most sort of, like, purest form of gluttony?
Craig Norris
Ever. That&rsquo;s something within something within something.
Taylor Lidstone
No, no, no. It&rsquo;s a songbird.
Craig Norris
Oh, OK.
Taylor Lidstone
And they drown it in whiskey. So the whiskey enters the lungs. Yeah. And then you eat the whole thing whole. And all of its bones stick into your mouth and the blood rushing out of your own mouth is the major part of the flavour profile of the dish. It was Henry, the eighth favourite dish.
Speaker
Oh really?
Craig Norris
It looks into that way deeper.
Evelyn Lambeth
That doesn&rsquo;t surprise me. About him, yeah.
Craig Norris
I mean, it does speak to the attitudes towards an animal that you&rsquo;re willing to convert it into a a torturous form of pleasure and it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s.
Evelyn Lambeth
Have you eaten it?
Taylor Lidstone
Of course not.
Evelyn Lambeth
Yeah. On that note there, I guess this just goes back to your question of had things gotten better? And I think this has been done for a while, but I think. The amount of information and how quickly it&rsquo;s shareable now is maybe just illuminating things more than shaping new technologies, but one of them, there&rsquo;s something called Canada Trippin, which is a. It&rsquo;s a hormone based product from horse blood, so there&rsquo;s wild.
Craig Norris
Right.
Evelyn Lambeth
Horse farms, they&rsquo;re only legal, and for this production we have horse farms all over the world because horse blood is really useful for oestrogen treatment, many hormone therapies.
Speaker
Ah.
Evelyn Lambeth
But in terms of food production, the only three countries that allowed Uruguay, Iceland and Argentina, so they let the horses run wild, get the mayor pregnant, take 5 litres of her serum every week while she&rsquo;s pregnant, ship it to piggeries, introduce it into the sow just after she gives birth, because she can reenter estrus.
Craig Norris
Horse glad into the.
Evelyn Lambeth
And then they introduced it into the baby stows. Sorry. The baby piglets. And because they can enter puberty much earlier and then they abort the foetus, get pregnant again. And it&rsquo;s the conditions for the horses are horrible because it&rsquo;s a hormone. So it doesn&rsquo;t matter about the size of the animal. It&rsquo;s concentration of blood.
Speaker
Really.
Craig Norris
Holy cow.
Taylor Lidstone
Holy horse.
Evelyn Lambeth
Holy.
Craig Norris
Horse. Yeah. Yeah. So, I mean, I mean, this brings this question of, I guess, food safety and sustainability. Are there things? We should be. Concerned about that you found in your research around some of these concerns? Around pork in in Australia.
Evelyn Lambeth
Absolutely. I think.
Craig Norris
It&rsquo;s that that&rsquo;s not happening in Australia the the. Blood being introduced.
Evelyn Lambeth
We&rsquo;re importing the pork, so it depends how you how you can stick it. Yeah, I thought.
Taylor Lidstone
Right. We&rsquo;re complicit.
Evelyn Lambeth
You got off. Yeah, I think. I&rsquo;ve been thinking a lot about what I hope to do with this research and like I don&rsquo;t want to scare people away. A lot of people are never going to read my thesis, but it&rsquo;s like.
Speaker
Hey.
Evelyn Lambeth
Where I see the biggest availability to make impact would be if we centre the human because I think it&rsquo;s much harder. You know, people be like I&rsquo;ll be a vegetarian and even if I tell them all the things that they seem, well it&rsquo;s still better than eating meat and you go OK, OK, so. But if we are going to eat meat and if we do need the pigs for all these other. Vital resources how do we care for them better and subsequently care for ourselves? So, but looking at ways to maybe consider that and there&rsquo;s definitely some researchers out there who&rsquo;ve thought about slaughterhouses and looked at human labour policy and how to make that better. But again, like, I think part of history is looking at continuity and change and the things that remain the same are usually the most problematic. So there&rsquo;s like. Do you all know Upton Sinclair&rsquo;s book The Jungle?
Craig Norris
No Upton Sinclair&rsquo;s the jungle. The jungle, is it fictional or not?
Evelyn Lambeth
The jungle. It is fictional actually, but based on. Fact. OK. If it&rsquo;s a an expose, if you will written in or published in 1906. But it was looking at the Chicago meat packing industry and talking about the just. Sounds like you&rsquo;re reading a sci-fi novel. But out of that.
Craig Norris
Is it small and green? Is that what we were eating? Swelling green. The the great Charlton Heston sci-fi novel about food? Where?
Evelyn Lambeth
What&rsquo;s that? You know what? I recently also thought about Margaret Atwood&rsquo;s maddaddam series, so it works. And Craig is of one of that series and she has like chicken Nuggets. And is it Pugliese? It&rsquo;s like a pig human combination. Anyway, it was written a while ago, but it&rsquo;s like, super relevant.
Craig Norris
But Sinclair&rsquo;s book on the meat packing industry.
Evelyn Lambeth
Going back 1906. He wrote that to talk about the conditions and so people took food safety out of that which they were legitimate food safety concerns. But the other point he was trying to make were he was looking at a Lithuanian family that had immigrated, and the only jobs they could get. Were in this. Certain meat packing industry, which is true, is still across the world today. 70% of the world slaughterhouse workers are migrant workers, so there&rsquo;s an effect. It&rsquo;s called the Sinclair effect.
Craig Norris
Yeah, right.
Evelyn Lambeth
But basically there&rsquo;s a direct correlation between domestic violence and slaughterhouse work. And so when you think about that, the what bleeds out of the slaughterhouse is much bigger than the meat that&rsquo;s packaged for you.
Craig Norris
And that&rsquo;s almost the kind of metaphysical point around. One&rsquo;s exposure to a particular. Well, the type of violence, right? This is a very sanctioned violence of human to animal, which is normalised. And, you know, we don&rsquo;t at all have any contact with it. When we go to a supermarket. To get up the packaged. Pork mince or something, so it&rsquo;s frightening to think of when you&rsquo;re at the coalface of actually beginning that food chain process. That I&rsquo;m very foreign to. There might be some flow into domestic violence through.
Evelyn Lambeth
Harsh reality, so I think. Bringing people&rsquo;s awareness to that, not in a way to minimise or steer them away from wanting to enact change. But it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s much bigger than just how, so how we care for animals inevitably impacts how we. Treat each other and from from Australian context I think a.
Craig Norris
And that&rsquo;s a really good point.
Evelyn Lambeth
Lot. About the legacies of wealthy countries and how that wealth came to be and. Particularly around things like phosphate and all these precious minerals and mining, and it&rsquo;s everywhere in the news right now. When you devastate a countries, resources like Nauru, for instance, we mine 70% of their phosphates in the 60s and. There&rsquo;s like a list of nine countries that are used in agricultural work in Australia and a lot of those. Come. From now we&rsquo;re being but one example of places where we&rsquo;ve desecrated the local landscape to extract things that we need in Australia and then now. Use some of that work in remittance schemes and slaughterhouse work as a. We&rsquo;re inviting you into the country, but it doesn&rsquo;t go back. You know, there&rsquo;s remittance.
Craig Norris
Yeah. And within these concerns, yeah. And and because as you&rsquo;re mapping out within these concerns, there are questions of the how, how we can see the future of pork, right, if we&rsquo;re highlighting these concerns as you&rsquo;re saying, well, where do you see the future of pork going?
Evelyn Lambeth
You need it and you don&rsquo;t, but yeah. It feels very dystopian, I think. A couple of years ago they opened a 1.2 million capacity piggery in China. It&rsquo;s 23 stories.
Craig Norris
1.2. Of 23 Storey piggery.
Evelyn Lambeth
20 three Storey in the middle of a city.
Craig Norris
Holy cow.
Evelyn Lambeth
Yeah.
Craig Norris
And it&rsquo;s just mass processing pigs.
Evelyn Lambeth
Takes.
Craig Norris
It&rsquo;s a huge slaughterhouse 23.
Evelyn Lambeth
It&rsquo;s a huge slaughterhouse. A lot of it&rsquo;s. It but. We&rsquo;re not using their manure for anything productive. When you think about genetic diseases, they can jump species. Now things like COVID and you know if everything gets blamed on.
Craig Norris
Yeah.
Evelyn Lambeth
China, for that particular disease, but the bird flu originated in the US, the bird flu that&rsquo;s going around right now, right. There&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a species problem. It&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a human problem. It&rsquo;s not a a race or a nationality problem.
Craig Norris
That&rsquo;s devastating. Yes. Yeah. So as you&rsquo;re saying, yeah, the in terms of the future of of consumption and production. Of livestock where seeing some really troubling previous practises that are now, yeah, combining with globally and then as you&rsquo;re saying, yeah, there&rsquo;s 23 level pig harvesting slaughterhouse. Wow in the middle of. The uhm city.
Evelyn Lambeth
In the middle of a city? Yeah, and. When I think. What I hope will happen is that we go from seeing food not as a commodity, but is it good again as a as a human right, I think you know, it&rsquo;s hard to pinpoint exactly when it went from being a good to a commodity, but that shift.
Craig Norris
Is pervasive, so by good what would be an example of? Of that category, something which hasn&rsquo;t.
Evelyn Lambeth
Good.
Craig Norris
Yet been changed into.
Evelyn Lambeth
Or maybe good or resource if we want to use commodity or resource. If we think about it as something that is finite, not something that we can. Make more of indefinitely like water as a resource, air as a resource cobalt phosphate.
Craig Norris
Yeah. And and certainly I think that that takeaway of demonstrating some kindness in that equation rather than a kind of. Violence was going to say dehumanising, but I guess that&rsquo;s the answer proceedings still right that that I can&rsquo;t think outside of a human centric. Explanation of judging the ethics and morality of that, and it&rsquo;s very tough talking cross species to say, you know we&rsquo;re dehumanising pigs. Well, they&rsquo;re not human. Well, what am I expressing there? What? How? How? How, how how? How do we teach kindness?
Evelyn Lambeth
Yeah, and it gets, yeah, those stories we tell about them dehumanise what is a human. We introduce human DNA into pigs so that we can grow organs and heart valves that are adaptable.
Craig Norris
Beyond the heat. Ranks.
Evelyn Lambeth
So. I just think like, oh, well, I don&rsquo;t have a kidney need from a pig. And I&rsquo;m like, but some people do. And like, if you care for this child that has kidney disease, if we think about that is an amazing resource, like what technology and science can do, that&rsquo;s incredible. If we can potentially use pig hearts, where there&rsquo;s such a shortage in a human and it works well. But it matters. I want a heart that I would want a heart from a pig that had a good life.
Craig Norris
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Looking it was striking to hear about the diabetes. Insulin linked to pigs. I had no idea that the history of insulin and diabetes went something synthetic or something about penicillin and mould. It was, actually. Animal based. Yeah. Wow. And yeah. Yeah. I hadn&rsquo;t even thought about the use of pigs for replacement organs. Wow, yeah.
Evelyn Lambeth
So I guess through all of this you asked a while ago what?
Speaker
2nd.
Evelyn Lambeth
If I&rsquo;ve noticed any cultural shifts and. Pigs are demonised. The metaphors we use about pigs are really. Mostly problematic. But not often times true, like based in fact.
Craig Norris
Because when you&rsquo;re. Because if you&rsquo;re seeing someone being a glutton and eating a lot of food, you will you call a pig.
Evelyn Lambeth
Sweating like a pig. Pigs don&rsquo;t really sweat.
Craig Norris
Putting like a.
Taylor Lidstone
He&rsquo;s looking a bit Porky.
Craig Norris
OK. Yeah.
Evelyn Lambeth
Yeah, spreading like a pig goes back to pig iron it. It refers to the sweltering, sweltering process of when it when it condenses and droplets form on the pig iron, which is the shape of the.
Speaker
Oh.
Craig Norris
Now wait. Little bit of iron, so it was the fact that iron for some reason was referred to pig as pig iron. That&rsquo;s crazy and didn&rsquo;t help pigs at all.
Evelyn Lambeth
And maybe you would not call someone like, say, someone sweating like a pig. You knew that it wasn&rsquo;t even like, oh, you look like.
Craig Norris
No, no, no.
Evelyn Lambeth
Some. Iron. Well, thank you so much. What a compliment.
Craig Norris
I am an Iron Man. Well, we&rsquo;re pretty much at time. Everyone. This has been such a fascinating little entry point. If people want to find out. More about the research and studies you&rsquo;re doing. Where can they find you?
Evelyn Lambeth
That&rsquo;s a great question. Well, hopefully I&rsquo;ll finish writing this thesis soon. I reckon if you just search pork problems and my name, there&rsquo;ll be some stuff that I&rsquo;ve published that comes up. Yeah. And then stay tuned.
Craig Norris
Excellent. Well, Evelyn Lambeth, absolute pleasure to have you.
Evelyn Lambeth
On thanks Joe, for having me.
Craig Norris
We&rsquo;ll post whatever links we can to the material you&rsquo;ve mentioned the what is it? The what&rsquo;s the link one?
Evelyn Lambeth
Everything but the link.
Craig Norris
About the link and and some links you&rsquo;ve you&rsquo;ve had when I send you some, you&rsquo;ve had one paper published, probably some other research as well, and if they search you on, you know UTAS and other spaces, they&rsquo;ll be able to. You got that great work well. Good luck. You&rsquo;re in the home stretch. I guess in your third year now. So fantastic stuff. And yeah, a lot to think about there.
Evelyn Lambeth
Thanks. I appreciate it. Thanks for.
Craig Norris
Listening. Thank you. So keep listening now to Edge radio. Coming up, we&rsquo;ve got Edge ID because there&rsquo;s never a song in the system. We&rsquo;re gonna play a song, but eventually there&rsquo;ll be.
Speaker
Music. Yeah. Listen to radio.
