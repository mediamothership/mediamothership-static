<p>We continue our discussion of Film Courage&#8217;s &#8220;A Guide to Writing Evil Characters.&#8221; In this segment, we explore the tropes of &#8220;Evil Characters We Root For&#8221; and &#8220;Techniques for Creating Empathy.&#8221; We take a closer look at characters such as Conquest from the <em>Invincible </em>series, Agent Smith from <em>The Matrix</em>, and Davros from <em>Doctor Who</em>. And, of course, we cover the latest news in media and popular culture.</p>

Speaker 1
You are about to experience the knowledge and insights of the medium mothership.
Craig
Alright, welcome here to media mothership on Edge radio. 99.3 FM. I&#8217;m your host Craig Norris, joined by the.
Taylor
Go to.
Craig
Then, well, I think I I thought I&#8217;d just do. I don&#8217;t really know what I&#8217;m talking about tonight, so I thought, you know, I&#8217;m not really leaning on the doctor part. OK, I&#8217;m more of the consumer part in terms of, I don&#8217;t know what. I&#8217;m talking about tonight. We&#8217;re we&#8217;re engaging with movie screen writing and character development, and while I&#8217;ve never written a film. I have. I have been an extra in a student film. And well, and and an indie film. Yeah, right. The big, big love studio guys. Here in Hobart and I watch a lot of movies and I did study in my undergraduate European cinema at the unit European cinema for a semester needed two cinema study subjects anyway, so I&#8217;m Craig Norris. I joined my co-host Taylor Taylor. What&#8217;s your world? What&#8217;s that world? What&#8217;s?
Taylor
Up.
Craig
Your background in. Movies.
Taylor
I don&#8217;t know. I&#8217;ve never been in one. Oh, yeah, I have.
Craig
I mean, you&#8217;ve acted, at least you&#8217;ve done theatre acting.
Taylor
Been in one. Yeah, yes, the theatre acting and film acting the Nightingale.
Speaker
Yeah, OK. What was?
Craig
Your role in the Nightingale, Nightingale, of course. As a Tasmanian movie filmed in Tasmania about the convict period to really. Dark heart wrenching emotional journey.
Taylor
Yeah, I was in it. I&#8217;ve never. Watched it. Really, yeah.
Craig
What was the in the filming that you did? What was?
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
The role you were playing.
Taylor
I was playing Ohh. What is it? Launceston townsfolk?
Craig
Right. So you had. Era appropriate clothing for the.
Taylor
Ohh yeah, I was ninja. I had sideburns which I grew out for six months.
Craig
For the sold really great. Really. Yeah. So you played the role of a British soldier? Yes or yeah, one of and. You were an extra, though, so you were. You weren&#8217;t. You didn&#8217;t have any.
Taylor
Speaking roles, not not a speaking role. No, but but it was a credited extra.
Craig
OK.
Taylor
Which is. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m on IMDb, etcetera.
Craig
No kidding, Taylor. IMDb is that the one role at the moment?
Taylor
That appears, yeah, yeah.
Craig
Yeah, we&#8217;ll have to add a couple of episodes.
Taylor
Of course.
Craig
All right, great. So. In a way, you&#8217;ve played a type of villain. Would you say that? Identity was from the point of view of some characters, would be seen. As a villain, no. Really. I mean wouldn&#8217;t, wouldn&#8217;t, wouldn&#8217;t there be some characters in that film that would see? The British. Army as villains though.
Taylor
Yeah, but yeah, well, I haven&#8217;t seen the movie, but I&#8217;m just guessing from history. There is like so it&#8217;s it&#8217;s difficult because there&#8217;s the the main villain played by Sam Claflin, the fellow who plays Finnick in The Hunger Games. He&#8217;s the main villain and.
Speaker 4
OK.
Craig
Is he British officer?
Speaker
That&#8217;s.
Taylor
Irish.
Craig
Right. Is this soldier or?
Taylor
Well, sort of like Irish sort of thing. And we basically he gets found out to have molested this sort of slave girl, I guess. And we all just look at him and he&#8217;s being publicly humiliated through that. So technically against the villain, I guess in a way.
Craig
That was the scene you&#8217;re in, right? So the scene you&#8217;re in, you want part of villainous Hanks. OK, OK, well, villain adjacent.
Taylor
Sort of thing. Yeah, yeah. Villains Jason. Well, actually no, for that role I had to. They gave us a pipe and we had. To smoke a pipe.
Craig
How did you smoke a pipe? Do you smoke? No. So how did you do the?
Taylor
Fake smoke. I just like drew it into my cheeks and then puffed it. Out.
Craig
Well, ruining the magic of movies your own media mothership.
Taylor
Oh yeah.
Craig
So indeed, as that little segue to introduce the show has foretold, omnium mothership we look at how the media shapes our world around us and we love these moments of behind the scenes how the sausage is made experiences so not actual smoking, but fake smoking.
Taylor
OK.
Craig
For that scene. We&#8217;ll be continuing last week&#8217;s discussion of villains, so we&#8217;ll unpack a little bit more. What makes a good villain?
Taylor
So just give me a moment I&#8217;ve forgotten to pay for parking.
Craig
And. That&#8217;s a villainous act, isn&#8217;t it? Yeah. You&#8217;re still in character. I notice. And in your acting, I know you played good guys. You were a detective in an Agatha Christie.
Taylor
It is. Yeah, that was on stage.
Craig
Yeah, on stage. Have you done any stage performances which are villain bees?
Taylor
I&#8217;m trying to think. Yes, I was murderer too in Macbeth.
Craig
Great. Alright, so that&#8217;s.
Taylor
I was in. I was in.
Craig
A sword fight that is so fantastic, drawing upon those experiences or that experience. Yeah, we&#8217;re going to explore your thoughts on what makes some good villains in cinema. Probably you&#8217;ve not seen most of. The movies, so that&#8217;s part of. The fun? Yeah, of course, Harry Potter.
Taylor
Is this? I&#8217;ve seen it.
Craig
You have right so you can as we&#8217;re talking about this topic. Feel free to SMS US on 0488811707. We&#8217;re also on YouTube and Twitch. You can post a message on the chat there well in the future in the future, yeah. So all that more. But before we do that, let&#8217;s cover.
Taylor
Patreon. Of beer.
Craig
Some some news. Oh, that&#8217;s not cheat.
Taylor
It is tuned. You just played it wrong.
Craig
Alright, really interesting article from Cydia. What&#8217;s that comic book were you all? The same thing.
Taylor
OK.
Speaker
Yeah.
Craig
Anyway, Superman Toy confirms identity of a mysterious character. Fans have been debating for months. The reason why I quite like this article was it&#8217;s one of these classic movements with the with the paratext. So you&#8217;ve got the text, the film, the new Superman movie that&#8217;s around the corner, and then you got these spin-off properties, right. So the movie poster, the Happy Meal, McDonald&#8217;s meal thing, games.
Taylor
Game. Is there a thing?
Craig
All that stuff usually comes out with a big movie. And they&#8217;re referred to as paratext. Or maybe a bit of transmedia, right? It goes to a different format like. In this case, the toy line. And it&#8217;s one of these wonderful moments where, again, you have the forensic fandom ideas, so fans are out there forensically sorting through content to get the kind of gotcha moment or the reveal moment to get a little bit of cultural capital from their other fans to say, hey, look what I&#8217;ve discovered. This one is is a toy line, right? And it&#8217;s happened numerous occasions where the toy line has a bit of publicity leading up to the film, and lo and behold, it reveals a character which had been, you know, rumoured or held off on in the.
Taylor
Trailer. So is it like a character? That&#8217;s suited up and then you can take the helmet off.
Craig
Or something. I know in the past there&#8217;s been cases of of that level of reveal in terms of, OK, bringing this character back. Even though the producers had hoped to keep it a secret, so it&#8217;s a big surprise when you&#8217;re watching the film. I won&#8217;t. I won&#8217;t spoil it for people by going into what this article proclaims.
Taylor
Really. Really. Do you think anyone in Hobart is actually going to be buying one of these?
Craig
The toy line has revealed. Global reach man for Kansas, Kansas listeners in America. OK, but yeah, nevertheless, fun moment where you know, you&#8217;re kind of big. See where it gets revealed. From a flyer.
Taylor
I mean, this is just great radio, you could. You&#8217;ve just said that there&#8217;s this big secret of something and then you haven&#8217;t revealed anything of it. Wow.
Craig
Kotaku next article from Kotaku. Ubisoft explains.
Taylor
Is there anything from Gizmondo today?
Craig
I got IGN and and anyway OK. Sorry, that&#8217;s spoiling. Ubisoft explains why you can&#8217;t kill animals in assassin Creed Shadows. The game.
Taylor
I mean, that&#8217;s just basic. You should be able. To kill everything in it.
Craig
The game director decides. OK, so why do you why do you think it is that in the latest Assassin&#8217;s Creed, the one that&#8217;s set in Japan, the. Game designers made an effort so.
Taylor
Is it something to do with animal spirits? No, no, OK. They just couldn&#8217;t be bothered to animate it.
Craig
Very practical. The games director cites a lack of predators in Japan and a desire to create a more Zen like open one.
Speaker
Yeah, that&#8217;s a.
Taylor
Lack of predators in Japan, so you should be able to slice a.
Craig
Rabbit in half predators. Except for humans, the ultimate predator. Or maybe the predator, right? So again, two things there. Zenlike approached the world. So they took a A. And moral, philosophical stance to this film that they want animal lovers to enjoy. This right? No animals been harmed in the creation of this game kind of vibe that that you can&#8217;t. You know, there&#8217;s a lot of kittens, right? The screen capture, for instance that they&#8217;ve got is a kitten.
Taylor
Absolute rubbish.
Craig
The your, your your neck it seems I I agree it seems I mean this game has hasn&#8217;t creed. Shadow has been bedevilled. That&#8217;s true by issues around. You know, dealing inappropriately with sensitive topics, for instance shrines also are non damageable and this was based on controversy earlier on where you know I think there&#8217;s been some incorrect lettering, the strains. You&#8217;re incorrect anyway, a whole series of issues have before in this in terms of, you know, kind of political economy, a sense that this is politically insensitive or cultural preparation. Anyway, this is the latest one that the game review was saying. They were surprised to find the player can never attack or kill any animals in the games. Virtual recreation of feudal Japan. And they would have pride.
Taylor
That&#8217;s crazy. I mean, even in the earliest links like Zelda games, you could cut the grass. You could eat a.
Craig
Chicken well, yeah, they say you can. However pet them and draw pictures of them.
Speaker 1
Ohh.
Craig
Unlike so many other open world games, including previous Ubisoft projects, there aren&#8217;t even any aggressive predators, so I guess.
Taylor
Like bears and.
Craig
Yeah, like in Red Dead Redemption. It&#8217;s not Ubisoft, but other game open world game spaces like Red Dead Redemption. You&#8217;ll have, you know, grizzly bears. Wildcats that you know, are predators and will attack you, and so you can battle and kill them. Yeah. This one has taken the view that because the only animals you&#8217;re going to encounter are are non predator based, right? So cats and stuff.
Taylor
Medic through CNN.
Craig
You&#8217;re not going to be in a situation where you&#8217;re forced to survive in that scenario like you&#8217;re not gonna be encountering. A wolf. Or a bear. I mean, there are wolves and bears in Japan, but nevertheless in the in the locations you&#8217;re in, I guess the temples and so forth. So yeah. Yeah. They want to send like a bridge.
Speaker 5
Hmm.
Craig
Yeah, yeah. I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s a selling points, if it&#8217;s taking the moral high ground here. If animal lovers are really going to embrace that.
Taylor
I think it&#8217;s just. Another nail in the coffin of that.
Craig
Game. Well, on that point, keeping the kind of video game set in Japan, IGN has an article about the the follow up series to what is it the consumer? Right, so this is ghosts of yottaa. So this is the. Next follow on game from Ghosts of Tsushima, which is set during the ****** attempted invasion in Japan. This one is the follow up, so ghost of Yokai director Val&#8217;s to deliver a respectful representation of Japan on par.
Speaker 5
OK.
Craig
With ghosts of tashina. And again, that&#8217;s in conversation with the failure of the Assassin&#8217;s Creed shadows game. To effective to I mean it costs so much backlash. Hmm. So there it&#8217;s interesting. They&#8217;re selling point for this game is that, hey, we are the respect for game designers. We&#8217;re going to take a lot of care to this. So again, a lot of nervousness, a lot of egg shells around the representation of Japan, which is interesting. Even I guess the prominence that period of Japan reached with the Shogun series from last year, which was a huge success. One all these awards. So you can see these game studios jumping into this space to represent it. But yeah, because of the bad publicity around. Incorrectly getting some of the details or being seen as insensitive to the handling of it. I wonder if they&#8217;re gonna allow you to kill animals in this. Is that a? Are we being kind of? Baby cuddled a bit. You know Nanny state a bit in terms of not seeing the repercussions. I mean, the fact that humans do kill animals and that maybe we should.
Taylor
See you.
Craig
Sense the wrongness. Of that little rightness of that times.
Taylor
I mean in Skyrim for example, I got a mod which allows you to sever the parts of animals if you want. So you can then put the different parts into a pot to cook that particular part.
Craig
And I guess if you&#8217;re trying to immerse yourself into a reality.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
Well, yeah, I guess I wouldn&#8217;t do that. And there is this whole thing of what farm to plate in the real world, right? People have lost the idea of where food comes from, if they&#8217;re just going to willies and seeing mints.
Taylor
Exactly.
Craig
That that we need to bring back that sense of of what the actual reality of it is, is. Has that helped you in terms of your eating habits? Do you now look at food differently?
Taylor
Yeah, yeah, I eat more meat than ever.
Craig
The meat lobby would love. Love you, all right, AIS, Technica.
Taylor
From pork on your.
Craig
Technica the Empire Strikes Back with F bombs AI Darth Vader.
Taylor
Ohh that that&#8217;s all I wanted to talk about. There was something I I knew there was something I had.
Speaker 1
Yeah.
Taylor
This week and I wanted to talk about it.
Craig
Yeah, it&#8217;s a big story. We we, Yep. So the subtitle here is Sith happens. This is funny. Brilliant. The Empire strike spec with F bombs AI Darth Vader goes rogue with profanity slurs Fortnite AI voice trained on James Earl Jones spoke curse words and insults before it was patched, so this of course is in a very very popular Fortnite game where you&#8217;re. Third person well, not shooter. Third person kind of fighter. Incredibly popular. They&#8217;ve dropped in some Star Wars characters, including Darth Vader that you can encounter. We&#8217;ll play a clip.
Taylor
Ohh really brilliant. Great idea.
Craig
Ohh, hold on, I haven&#8217;t. I haven&#8217;t hooked it up. Well, eventually will. And what was your? How did you come across?
Taylor
This story ohh this was this just appeared in my sort of like news feed because that&#8217;s what happened. You have a Samsung phone, you just swipe it to the left and it&#8217;s got all the news that&#8217;s been tailored specifically for you. And so yeah, I&#8217;ve watched. I&#8217;ve watched a couple of the. The videos, and not only did they did it speak curse words and things like that, but it started saying, oh, what did it say? Something along the lines. They always make it so they talk about Hitler and so it said something around Hitler being right, that sort of thing, I think and.
Speaker 5
Right, right, right.
Craig
OK, well I&#8217;ve. Queued it. I&#8217;ve kind of cued it up.
Taylor
OK. Yeah.
Speaker
What freaking ******* food is that? Darth Vader? Tell me. Ohh my God.
Speaker 1
Cool down.
Speaker 7
Freaking ******* such vulgarity does not become you, Patty. You inquire about sustenance and yet speak like a common thug.
Speaker 1
What you&#8217;re not allowed.
Speaker 6
Oh my God. Oh my God.
Craig
So what&#8217;s that?
Speaker 7
What sustains me?
Speaker
Oh my God, no.
Speaker 7
You. No, no, that is and it&#8217;s composition it is.
Speaker
You made him swear.
Craig
So what&#8217;s happening there is a gamer is making the AI Darth Vader swear because they engage in the conversation by swearing to begin with. Yeah. So she says, you know, freaking ****** eating. Food and then the Darth Vader character incorporates that language.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
Those words in their response to make it appear as if you&#8217;re actually talking to something vaguely realistic. But unfortunately it hadn&#8217;t been patched at all. They hadn&#8217;t realised that if people swear that swearing gets incorporated into the answer that Darth Vader replies. So Darth Vader said something like. You know, while he recognises it&#8217;s inappropriate, like, that&#8217;s inappropriate, he had made to say this freaking ****** word. But he says freaking ******. So this was the controversy that it was also using the fact that it&#8217;s James L Jones&#8217;s voice. Right. So they&#8217;re trained, they&#8217;ve got the estates permission.
Speaker
Yeah.
Craig
To allow them to create a language model based on the archive of genes or juice&#8217;s real voice. Put it in the. Team, of course, part of the conditions since. Yeah, there&#8217;s I think there&#8217;s legal action now being taken against them from the estate that they&#8217;re in breach of the terms and conditions for allowing this to happen. That of course it&#8217;s brought into some disrespect. James Silver, James&#8217;s voice.
Speaker
Hmm.
Taylor
That is the tip of the iceberg of the bad things that it said though. I&#8217;m pretty sure someone asked it to rank skin. Colour. No, they did and it put white as acceptable.
Craig
Really.
Speaker
So.
Taylor
Brown as unacceptable. Black is even more unacceptable. That&#8217;s the the clip that I saw that they had, which I think is a bit more than swearing.
Craig
Yeah. It&#8217;s horrible, isn&#8217;t it? In a way.
Taylor
A bit more harsh when&#8217;s weary?
Craig
Very villainous, right? So so.
Taylor
Yes, cases in character.
Craig
Also, well, yes, but also, yeah, the kind of reality there is taking advantage of the system, right. So the. These these people that are wanting to corrupt and exploit by performing offensiveness.
Taylor
But from that point it it just shows that it was definitely an AI model that had that did not have the restrictions in place that it needed. And like when they&#8217;ve had all of these other ones that they&#8217;ve brought out, there was the one that. Twitter brought out, I think it was called, I think it was called Taylor. Actually, and that within two hours it had started swearing and going through all of this.
Craig
Yeah. I think it was Microsoft&#8217;s.
Taylor
Yeah, yeah, something like that, yeah.
Craig
Tay, I like how you&#8217;ve identified with.
Taylor
It. Yeah, I know, because it was in the news. I was like, oh, God, another reason.
Craig
Yeah, yeah. And they basically, yeah, I think it was the the early experiment Microsoft did with AI or language learning models, right? It&#8217;s not really AI.
Speaker 5
Yeah.
Craig
And then they they put it into the wild, and a lot of people were able similar to this be able to basically groom the AI to become a a foul racist. And the thing was, I guess it was how quickly the corrupting began of that, that AI model.
Speaker
Hmm.
Taylor
But again, it&#8217;s it&#8217;s just a programme, just put in some things in place to stop it ever getting to that point.
Craig
And it is a sad reflection on humanity in terms of our desire to troll and to corrupt. And.
Taylor
But at the same time, like as a teacher. If you tell a student not to throw something, then all they wanna do is just throw throw it across.
Craig
The room. Maybe this is again another case of this is a reasonably safe space for that type of corruption to occur, right? And it&#8217;s interesting listening to that clip as well. Part of the fun. Of doing it was, as we heard in the reaction. Oh my God, I don&#8217;t believe I got defeated to say that it it is fun. I mean, the the appeal of the taboo, the. Appeal of saying naughty words.
Taylor
Or the naboo.
Craig
The Naboo saying the words you&#8217;re not meant to do, and there&#8217;s an appeal to that, I mean, I mean a. Lot of. It&#8217;s there. Well, yeah. I I&#8217;m thinking of a lot of humour. Is scatological a lot of humour is based on using to to do. I mean, I&#8217;m not talking about the the racist stuff, it&#8217;s more the. Kind of like getting into, say, the F. Weird.
Taylor
But can you really glean that much humour from?
Craig
Well, in a way, I mean, I guess, OK, an oppositional reading, right? So dominant reading would be ohh, this is really inappropriate and how bad on these people to exploit the system. A good one is it&#8217;s also kind of, you know. Mystifying the scariness of a villain character, right, that you can just kind of hack into the system and get this character that&#8217;s meant to be kind of like, Oh my God, I believe I&#8217;m battling against Darth Vader and instead you&#8217;re lampooning him and turning him into a clown, right, that you&#8217;re kind of.
Taylor
I suppose, yeah.
Craig
Demasculinization your kind of. Removing all of the villainy of this Darth Vader character and instead he&#8217;s yeah, you&#8217;re revealing that it&#8217;s just a bot and the bots dumb and the bot doesn&#8217;t know what to do. And so you can just get the bot to do something stupid and out of character. And I think that&#8217;s kind of creative.
Speaker
Hmm.
Craig
As well, I think had this is these aspects to this that are actually clever, right? I mean, figuring out that I mean and obviously you know within parameters you know clever in the initial thing you have this huge company spending all this money and taking all this care and usually there&#8217;s a huge risk averseness. To you know, carefully making sure all of these are calibrated for the market and they&#8217;re going to achieve X. Number of dollars. And it&#8217;s going to be great. And then when it&#8217;s just an epic fail because of some problem, the scrambling to fix it, you know, how bad can it get? Some of that is is is absurdly comical.
Taylor
Back on OK.
Craig
All right, so next next article? Yeah, another. Classically absurd things. So this is Mr Beast. Mr beast. So he&#8217;s a incredibly toxic, toxic but very famous and wealthy. YouTube, Mr Beast YouTuber James Donaldson denies wrongdoing over the Mayan ruins video.
Taylor
Oh, that&#8217;s right.
Craig
Yeah. So it&#8217;s some YouTube thing is doing and they got access to them. Yeah, that&#8217;s right. Yeah. They got access to the main pyramids ads. You know, they&#8217;ve denied any wrongdoing. But after that footage became public, this was that.
Speaker 5
With that.
Taylor
Well, he did. He got the steps or something like that. You&#8217;re not. Supposed to do that anymore? Yeah.
Craig
Oh, do you know how to pronounce it? Chichen itza. OK. The Mayan ruins in the Yucatan Peninsula, which is considered one of the seven.
Taylor
Yeah. Teaching it so.
Craig
Wonders of the world. Legally, visitors are. Welcome to come to the site, but they&#8217;re banned from climbing the pyramids or visiting it after nightfall. They appear to have done both, certainly after nightfall, because you know, part of.
Speaker
For the.
Craig
The video is that he says nobody gets to go where we&#8217;re going. And then he goes there, which suggests that.
Taylor
Paid off the government, probably.
Craig
Yeah, well, this is the I guess this is what this maybe is exposing. So yeah, again it&#8217;s it&#8217;s an interesting. Again, another one of these epic fails of I guess you know so much money. Just put into this, they would have. They would have to have known this would cause some fallout. I guess they thought either they&#8217;d they&#8217;d been able to pay off everyone who needs to get. Paid off and have.
Taylor
Yeah, they thought their star power could carry them. Yeah.
Craig
Well, maybe they just like the publicity, right? I mean.
Taylor
Any publicity is good publicity.
Craig
Yeah, this, this, this, this certainly is brought it to my attention and media motherships, listeners and it was on the ABC News. All right, last story last style story Star Wars Darth Jar Jar. Now available in Fortnite, but fans can&#8217;t believe you must earn 1,000,000 XP before you can buy him, so it&#8217;s one of these. Kind of, yeah. And the subtitle Empire Strikes bank. And it&#8217;s just, I mean, again, it&#8217;s moral economy question at the other end of that Darth Vader problem, where the fans get to, you know, kind of rewire Darth Vader to show the absurdity of the AI system underpinning it, or the language learning model and defending it. This one is the greed side of it, where the Darth Jar jar. Is a fan favourite character in terms of its bit of fan fiction with Jar Jar Binks the most ridiculed character in the Star Wars pantheon. Fan theory saying that actually he was the mastermind evil villain behind everything as a Sith Lord, so they they&#8217;d buy into this with Fortnite setting up a nice novel little idea that you can play as the dark version of this, but you have to grind for it. And it&#8217;s an absurd grind and it&#8217;s punishing. And it&#8217;s interesting at what point fans playing a free game. Push back against that mechanic and say no more.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
Really. This is greed. This is exploitative. This is taking something, you know fans want and forcing them to to to buy it at a preposterous price. You know that that price label or that time. Cost linked to it. Value is broken from the fans point of view that you know they&#8217;re they know this is something fans who. They&#8217;re charging an extraordinary price. You&#8217;re getting so upset. Thinking about it. Yeah, that there&#8217;s an unfairness to it. Right. But I mean, again, how? How effective their complaints can be. You know, who knows?
Taylor
Well, that just reminds me of when it comes to unfairness, greed and corporate iness we&#8217;ve got the new Switch 2 coming out. In is it 7 days or something like that? It&#8217;s on June 5th I think.
Speaker 1
And.
Taylor
Mario Kart world, priced at $130.00 or $120.00 or something like that, and it looks like that&#8217;s going to be the new normal for switch games, and probably PS2, PS, PS2, PS 5 and Xbox Games.
Craig
Yeah. Yes, there was another game where the game developers. That I think it&#8217;s the latest. Yeah, it&#8217;s the latest Borderlands game, Borderlands 4. The CEO has said. Because people are baulking at the price of it saying I feel they&#8217;re listed at 4, but the CEO in response to the $80 being charged for this game is is response was. If you&#8217;re a real fan, you&#8217;ll find a way right. Which again, is this moral economy moment, right? What do you do when you get that, let them eat cake moment. From the privileged power holder, right French Revolution. Style that that moral outrage of saying, you know, you just don&#8217;t get what it&#8217;s like in the cost of living today, that this $80 charge isn&#8217;t isn&#8217;t what this rich person&#8217;s imagining is, right. If you&#8217;re a real fan, you&#8217;ll find a way.
Taylor
No game should be above $100 is what I think.
Craig
Well, I guess this is within that $80.00, but yeah, it&#8217;s it&#8217;s it&#8217;s the response is, yeah, well yes, yes.
Taylor
$80 American.
Speaker 8
Yeah.
Craig
Yeah. So that, that&#8217;s yeah that that&#8217;s been considered quite tone deaf, alright.
Speaker
Hmm.
Craig
You&#8217;re.
Taylor
Talking about tone deaf.
Craig
You&#8217;re listening to its radio 9.3 FM. Stay clear of the platform. Let&#8217;s move to the main topic of today, villains, villains. Yep. So as I mentioned last week.
Taylor
Medusa.
Craig
Medusa. Yeah. Yeah. Ursula, you can you can flip those interesting female villains. I mean, I think female villains are alright anyway. Well, they.
Taylor
Jaffa.
Craig
Let&#8217;s pick it up from where we were last listening, just Disney. So what I want to go into now was a actually it was a Reddit post I came across. There&#8217;s an interesting Reddit post a few days ago which has its tidal. The question there&#8217;s moments in a movie where the the Pure Evil 1 dimensional villain gives a speech that recontextualizes them in the most terrifying way imaginable. OK, so it&#8217;s a speech. Well, I&#8217;ll play a couple of clips.
Taylor
I can&#8217;t think of any. The top of my head. Now phanos.
Craig
Yeah, tennis is a great example. Any particular scene from Thanos in particular you think?
Taylor
Yeah. Ohh, where he&#8217;s talking about bringing balance back, that&#8217;s what. That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m. Thinking of yes.
Speaker
Yeah.
Craig
Yeah, it&#8217;s great. See, I&#8217;ll play clip. OK. Play. Play clip right. Here we go for the perfect balance. So we&#8217;ll try it. 13 seconds. OK.
Speaker 9
Look. Pretty isn&#8217;t it? Perfectly balanced, as all things should be.
Craig
All right. So that&#8217;s the same way he meets Kimo.
Taylor
Ohh that&#8217;s we&#8217;ve got the the yeah, the knife.
Craig
Yeah, and and he is. I mean, it&#8217;s not. I mean it&#8217;s not necessarily it is recontextualizing them because in that scene we see a certain humanising quality to the villain. And an idea of their ideology.
Speaker
Oh.
Taylor
I&#8217;m talking about the one where he talks about after he&#8217;s done his famous snap. Yeah. And then he has the what&#8217;s it called then? He&#8217;ll look out upon a perfect world or something like that. Perfect human voice.
Craig
Maybe it&#8217;s this one.
Speaker 9
OK, brilliant. You could not live with your own failure. Yeah. Where did that bring you? Back to me. You could not live. Where did that bring you?
Taylor
Just playing random bits from Infinity War now.
Speaker 9
To me.
Craig
How? How about Thanos&#8217;s most powerful scene, OK.
Speaker 9
Congratulations, you&#8217;re a prophet. On the survivor.
Speaker 1
Who wants to murder trillions?
Speaker 9
With all 6 stones, I could simply snap my fingers. They would all cease to exist. I call that. Mercy.
Speaker
And then what?
Speaker 9
Finally, rest and watch the sunrise in the Grateful Universe. The hardest choices require the strongest one.
Taylor
That&#8217;s.
Speaker
Did you do it?
Speaker 9
Make it cost. Who wishes?
Craig
It is a. Great scene and that that scene where. He says, you know where. His kind of surrogate daughter up until that point, asks him, you know, what does it cost everything. Yeah, it is. It is a terrifying explanation of what the character is. So yeah, we want to go a little bit into that. The the Reddit post. Yeah. There&#8217;s a couple of really interesting examples it gives.
Speaker
Hmm.
Craig
But let&#8217;s first set the scene and have a look at maybe. I don&#8217;t. Lure of the dark side. Evil characters we root for techniques for creating empathy. Techniques for creating empathy. I think that&#8217;s the the the one we&#8217;re looking at here. So jumping into this is the film courage clip techniques for creating empathy for your villainous character. OK. OK, here we go.
Speaker 8
What is the definition of an antihero? An anti hero is someone who becomes evil for sympathetic reasons. This is why we like him. This is Michael Corleone in the Godfather. This is Harvey Dent in in in Dark Knight. We have to have sympathetic reasons to like an antihero.
Speaker 4
There&#8217;s a whole bunch of techniques and you can see what they. Do.
Craig
Alright, so sympathetic reasons to like a. Antihero. So some of the clips. I came across this one is from the new. UM, invincible. Cartoon series superhero series and then the last season in the last few episodes, they bring this new character. In called conquest. And conquest is this super powerful villain character. It&#8217;s it&#8217;s, you know, we&#8217;re talking about kind of evil Superman level and there&#8217;s this fantastic monologue that Conquest gives, which is similar to this question of at the moment where a character is pure evil, he&#8217;s demonstrated various evil acts. Of killing innocent people in very gory grizzly way. Is this villain? Who, up until this point with this monologue that we&#8217;re about to hear, seems to just be pure evil? But then he delivers this monologue, which changes our view of them somewhat, right? Maybe a little more empathy towards that character. So as we heard in that clip, we sometimes want. To create that. Empathy. So let&#8217;s listen to this one minute clip of Conquests&#8217;s best monologue from the Invincible anime series. This is season 3.
Speaker 1
I am so lonely. All the other philtre minds are scared of me. No one talks to me. No one wants to be my friend. They think I am unstable. They send me from planet to planet, committing atrocities in their name. And as I get better at it. They fear me more and more. I am a victim of my own success conquest. I don&#8217;t even get a real name. Only on purpose. I am capable of so much more, and no one sees it. Some days I feel so alone. I could cry, but I don&#8217;t. I never do, because what would be the point?
Speaker 8
I&#8217;m going.
Craig
To so that&#8217;s. Dramatic scene of conquest, delivering this really unexpected monologue about his loneliness. He&#8217;s so lonely. No one likes me. I have no friends, right? Everyone hates me so much that they&#8217;ve given me the name conquest. Which is just a purpose. Right. And it&#8217;s such a dramatic scene. The It&#8217;s interesting reading the. The quotes some of the the comments underneath it, talking about how dramatic that scene is, if we jump back to the film writing guide just to see how that empathetic moment can work.
Speaker 4
To know what the techniques are. For me, it&#8217;s like there&#8217;s three, three things that you do that I that you do is is make us make us feel sorry for that character. So there&#8217;s little moments where you can you can create a moment in the story where a character is unjustly abused or unjustly mistreated or insulted. Or. Betrayed or neglected. And so it it could be any character. And if that moment is there, you&#8217;re gonna feel sorry for that character at that moment. Takes an instant. So that&#8217;s one. If you show that they&#8217;re like us, if you show their humanity, for example, you show that they care about something other than themselves. That&#8217;s another technique.
Craig
So I felt. That that&#8217;s kind of the technique there. They&#8217;re not. They kind of like conquest. This, this viltrumite alien. Kind of villain character. He&#8217;s like a he&#8217;s he feels lonely. Right. He doesn&#8217;t have any friends, like he&#8217;s writing a diary entry. The a diary. I feel so lonely today. I have no friends anyway. It&#8217;s just really, profoundly banal, everyday depressing existential model.
Speaker 10
Ohh my God.
Speaker 4
So there&#8217;s a moment in the movie A Leon the professional, which is about a a, a hit man, right? And it opens with him doing a hit and he kills people you don&#8217;t know if he&#8217;s good or bad, but he goes home and he takes care of a plant. Right. And that right away, you say, oh, well, he cares about the plant, so he&#8217;s he&#8217;s OK. The other part is admiration. So this is like any. Any kind of you know, if you&#8217;re dating somebody or you&#8217;re trying to find somebody who was a good match for you, there&#8217;s that list of list of things that you like in a person that&#8217;s admirable trait. So somebody was funny. Who&#8217;s responsible, who&#8217;s courageous. That&#8217;s a whole list of things you can add to a character to make us say, oh, well, you know, I admire this. Usually they&#8217;re like, the best at what they do. They like the best. You know the best ad executive or the best agent or the best cop, or. The best driver? They&#8217;re courageous. There&#8217;s a whole bunch of them. I have hope. The list. The list is all in.
Craig
So there&#8217;s three characteristics there. One of the ones that was mentioned in the Reddit list of Moments in where a villainous character delivers a monologue which makes you see them a bit differently, is the scene from the matrix with Agent Smith, right? So this is the scene where. Morpheus has been captured. Agent Smith has been interrogating him. And then in this. Moment he takes off his earpiece so he&#8217;s no longer connected to the other kind of androids. And delivers this manogue monologue about his.
Taylor
Feelings manogue. Is that what a man?
Craig
Man alot. Gives. Well, here&#8217;s what a manity gives. So let&#8217;s. The.
Speaker 5
Going to be honest. With you. I. Hate this place? This. Zoo. Prison. This reality, whatever you want to call it, I can&#8217;t stand it any longer. It&#8217;s the smell. If there are such things. I feel saturated by it. They can taste your stink. You&#8217;re time I do. I fear that I have somehow been infected by it. It&#8217;s propulsive, isn&#8217;t it? I must get out of here. I must get free. And in this mind is the key my key.
Speaker 1
I was happy.
Craig
Such a such an interesting scene there that then again, that. Idea of humanising the villain.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
Up until this point, we&#8217;ve seen him as a kind of robot, kind of mechanical, villainous character, and then this, I must get free. I hate it here. I hate the smell. Very relatable.
Taylor
Mr. Anderson. Do you know who my favourite anti villain is? Yes, I don&#8217;t. Have a guess.
Craig
Well, some of the the I guess some of the classic anti villains, you got dirty Harry.
Taylor
No. It&#8217;ll be 1 you don&#8217;t expect.
Craig
Maybe the first act of Star Wars where it&#8217;s handsome.
Taylor
Because because they&#8217;re they&#8217;re not an anti villain. Sorry, anti hero.
Craig
Anti hero. Yeah anti villain would be. I hear it. Yeah. You, you, you finally got around to watching the Godfather.
Taylor
No, no, no. Corleone. It&#8217;s it&#8217;s an anti hero who is the main character.
Craig
Right, Harry Potter.
Taylor
Michael Douglas in falling down.
Craig
OK. Yeah. OK. Yeah, that&#8217;s a yeah. So falling down, there&#8217;s a note is the story of a kind of salary man in America. He loses his job, but then so embarrassed. Yeah. So embarrassed about the loss of his job that he can&#8217;t tell his wife. And he&#8217;s still going.
Taylor
Guys on the ranch.
Craig
I mean. You know, dressing up in his suit as if he still got his job and then he has one. Of these. Worst days possible.
Taylor
Yeah, he gets stuck in traffic.
Craig
Right and. It gets stuck in traffic, it gets bad service at a fast food restaurants, gets accosted by some some thugs, and he he just he just flips out and and does this weird wishful. So he&#8217;s he&#8217;s kind of villainous in terms of, you know, his. He he can&#8217;t face up to the truth. He. He&#8217;s lying. He then does extreme overreactions. Yeah, in these moments, but kind of like, you know, human overreactions, but ones which know, like, he gets a gun at some point, and he&#8217;s shooting people. He gets a baseball bat at some point, and he&#8217;s finally.
Taylor
Yeah.
Speaker 5
Yeah.
Craig
Bashing people, you know, it&#8217;s just it&#8217;s just disproportionate. Yeah. And also a sense of entitlement that that really these are not big problems. Yeah, that he&#8217;s facing. But he&#8217;s blowing them up. Yeah, it&#8217;s a great role. What? What? Was it about that? You, you. You.
Taylor
Enjoyed. Ohh. It&#8217;s it&#8217;s really like the movie and I&#8217;d I&#8217;d like that disproportionate response to it. And I was so sad when he got shot to death at the end. But.
Craig
Look, it is cause look tip. I mean, you could do a different version of. That movie where? He is redeemed right where it is that kind.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
Of which which? Is why I think the movie is so good that they don&#8217;t concede that trope of, you know, because basically. You know, it&#8217;s that kind of, you know what we&#8217;re seeing today with Trump saying that, you know, Oh my God, the worst person. And the people in the world are these oppressed, alleged, you know, white genocide sufferers in South South Africa, right. It&#8217;s this kind of, you know, the idea that that a, an identity which has been considered. The the patriarchal privileged norm white male in particular is somehow struggling and so not living a life. Which is meant to be the same, similar in falling down. It takes that hypocrisy or that sense of lack of of any sense of a realistic base of what real suffering might look like. Yeah. Yeah. No, that&#8217;s. Yeah, that&#8217;s a great choice. It&#8217;s an underprivileged. Watched movie. I feel it is.
Taylor
Yes.
Craig
All right. So let&#8217;s jump in. Where are we? What&#8217;s the time? 2 minutes left. Alright. So we&#8217;ll hear a little bit more about the guide. To writing evil characters.
Speaker 4
Book there&#8217;s all these lists of things you can do, but if you do these three things, and so when I show clips of the of the moment you meet the character and it&#8217;s usually like a 3 minute scene. You can see all these things being applied in like 3 minutes. There&#8217;s like, you know, the the opening of WALL-E after he&#8217;s done with the garbage and he comes to his to his little house. It&#8217;s a 3 minute scene and it&#8217;s about 20 of these techniques done. This is how you connect with that character in one scene emotionally. Also show a clip of a of A of an ad, a commercial. It&#8217;s a one minute. Thing about a lamb.
Craig
So the next one I mean, is this really interesting scene from well, in a way. Yeah. Some people in the chat mentioned this scene in Star Wars as being one which which. Agendas. Humanising of the of the character.
Speaker 7
So you have accepted the truth.
Speaker 4
I&#8217;ve accepted the truth.
Speaker 11
That you will, once Anakin Skywalker my father.
Speaker 7
That name no longer has any meaning for me.
Speaker 4
It is the name of your true self. You&#8217;ve only.
Speaker 1
Forgotten? No, there is good.
Speaker 5
The Emperor hasn&#8217;t driven it from you.
Speaker 9
For me to come.
Speaker 7
Hobby one, once thought as you do.
Speaker 5
I&#8217;m sorry, Eric. For all.
Speaker 7
Of it, you don&#8217;t know the power of the dark side. I must obey. I must.
Speaker 5
I will not turn.
Speaker
And you&#8217;ll be forced.
Speaker 7
To kill if that is with destiny.
Speaker 8
You can&#8217;t do this.
Speaker 11
I feel the conflict within you. Let go of. Your hate.
Speaker 7
We lose too late.
Speaker 1
My father is truly.
Craig
Different. Alright, so that&#8217;s the same return of the Jedi defender Luke Skywalker. And again, those moments where Darkseid is delivering those lanes of, you know you don&#8217;t know the power of the dark side. Not in terms of where you should join me in the dark side, but a true sense of the oppressiveness of that ideology is is under. And that final scene, you know. It&#8217;s too late for me, son. Is quite alright. Well that. Last clip one, I think that you&#8217;ll be. Able to respond. To sure. Again, here we have a classic scene. I want to tell you.
Taylor
Voldemort.
Craig
It&#8217;s not that. One, it&#8217;s the it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s Gollum. It&#8217;s something I know you&#8217;ve got a background in. It&#8217;s a scene where one of the big villains in this series is delivering a kind of justification for their actions.
Taylor
Let&#8217;s call.
Craig
Them right and. It&#8217;s it&#8217;s not necessarily humanising or admiring them, but it is providing us with an insight into, OK, well, they&#8217;re not just.
Taylor
MHM.
Craig
Doing villainy because yeah, they want to. It&#8217;s for some other reason.
Speaker 10
Now future errors will be eradicated, defeats will become victories. You will have changed the future of the.
Craig
Universe. So of course this is Doctor Who facing off against. Ross. Yeah, in the classic Tom Baker series. So this is this great kind of face off between the two characters. I&#8217;m just waiting until it gets to the scene that I want to.
Speaker 6
It&#8217;s not the machines, it&#8217;s the.
Craig
Unpack.
Taylor
This is genesis.
Craig
Of the dogs genesis. That&#8217;s right. Yeah. Genesis Daleks consider one of probably the best episodes in Doctor Who&#8217;s history. So there&#8217;s a bit of intellectual sparring between what these Daleks represents.
Speaker 10
With the darlings of the supreme rulers of the universe there. You will have peace. Wars will end. They are the power, not of evil. But of God.
Speaker 6
Davros. If you had created a virus in your laboratory, something contagious and infectious that killed on contact a virus that would destroy all other forms of life. Would you allow its?
Speaker 10
Use. It is an interesting conjecture, only living thing.
Speaker 6
Would you do?
Speaker 4
It.
Speaker 10
The microscopic Organism.
Speaker 9
Reigning supreme.
Speaker 10
Fascinating idea.
Speaker 6
But would you do it?
Speaker 10
Yes.
Speaker 1
Yes.
Speaker 10
To hold in my hand a capsule that contained such power. To know that life and death on such a scale was my choice. To know that the tiny pressure on my son enough to break the glass would end. Everything.
Speaker 1
Yeah.
Speaker 10
I would do it.
Speaker 11
That power would sit me up above the gods and through the darlings. I shall have that power.
Craig
Well, great scene, great scenes. So again, you know, in terms of Dan Ross&#8217;s villainy, you know, the Doctor asks that question. Of. You know Dave Ross, if in one of your experiments you created the virus accidentally that you discovered that virus could kill every living being, you know, would you decide to destroy that virus or not? And I guess it&#8217;s a test there of because what&#8217;s happening in this episode is the doctor is struggling with this. Decision of does he kill the Daleks or not? Like he said, the genesis of the Daleks highly suggest is is the inception point at which the Ducks begin. Doctor is afforded this opportunity to.
Taylor
Yes.
Craig
Wipe him out. To eradicate them at the moment of their. And so this question is kind of testing, is Davros really a bad game, right? Is there any remaining empathy or sense of, you know, if Davros answered, for instance, Gee, you know, yeah. Obviously, if I found that I&#8217;d accidentally made this virus that kills everyone. Yeah, that&#8217;s pretty horrible. I don&#8217;t want to kill everyone. I just want to.
Taylor
I think that&#8217;s also a turning point of where the Doctor realises that Davros would destroy if he could. And so therefore the right thing to do would be to not.
Craig
Destroy that, Davros ultimately is irredeemable in terms of even a hypothetical question. That&#8217;s not about creating a master race. Garlic species that are going to bring peace to the world, right? So again, that was just before then, but, you know. Actually, the dogs aren&#8217;t an instrument for evil. They like Thanos going to bring a sense of of balance and peace around us. We&#8217;re going to wipe out every other, you know, kind of aggressive species.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
And be left with peace. And yes, the dialects will just happen to be at the top of that space, so again he shifts it by saying OK, we&#8217;re not talking about dialects anymore, we&#8217;re talking about a virus, a virus that would even kill every other person here. And even with that, we were revealed the idea that DeVos is wants power. He wants at least to be recognised. Eyes. Like a God at being able to decide who lives and dies. So a very Thanos type God complex in terms of you know that it it&#8217;s nevertheless an attempt by the script writers to humanise that villain action. Right. Yeah. Why? Would someone want to do this? Why would someone want to create super soldiers?
Taylor
Daleks slash Nazis, which is what it was based on, yeah.
Craig
Yeah, yeah, yeah. And it&#8217;s such a fantastic unpacking of that, that, that idea. And I guess, yeah. So Davos doesn&#8217;t shift into being an anti villain. And to hear. The same thing. Anti hero? Yeah, because it&#8217;s potentially a lot a a kind of sequence of thoughts that could change the character. Yeah, right. Where he goes. Yes, I see now, doctor, the error of my ways right. Clearly there should be cheques and balances. I don&#8217;t just want to kill everyone, but there&#8217;s like.
Taylor
No, no. Why yes, now I would use that power.
Craig
One few to decide who lives and dies to be a God. Yeah. So it&#8217;s it&#8217;s. It&#8217;s a nice scene. And again the the the rising of the voice. And of course, yeah. Then the doctor decides. You know, he&#8217;s got to get Davros to kill the Daleks, right? You know, to wipe out Davros and the Daleks. Yeah. Think about that in terms of, if you&#8217;re finding yourself facing off against a villain, yeah, you know, raising a villain. Is there a moment to humanise them, and does that? Help create a more engaging story if you haven&#8217;t seen it, do watch falling down. Yeah worth watching and and yeah, that&#8217;s me meeting mothership for another week. We&#8217;ll dive into some more unpacking of media around us next week and. Before we sign off, any promotions for the new show, you&#8217;re setting up Taylor, no?
Taylor
Not yet.
Craig
They&#8217;re still Facebook, though. DM for Epley.
Taylor
There&#8217;s still a Facebook at DM for Airplay, but it&#8217;s not going to be for the next two weeks because I have exams next.
Craig
Week so. Ohh yeah. Wow. We, we you could do an exam themed music show. What music to listen to for exams?
Taylor
Songs to scratch out your eyes too.
Craig
Yeah, alright. Well, that&#8217;s the media mothership for another week. Keep listening now to some really cool tunes on Edge radio. If you want to find out more about the email, so feel free to jump on the Facebook page for us or the Instagram page. Back episodes are also on YouTube.
Taylor
