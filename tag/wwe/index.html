Craig
All right, welcome to. Media mothership here on Edge radio. 99.3 FM.
Speaker
Seth.
Craig
Seth Rollins, that. The through, you know, I&rsquo;m just gonna mash up and put wrestling ends in.
Marcus
I&rsquo;m OK with that. I mean, Seth Rollins is a good person.
Craig
To start with, it is unfortunately he&rsquo;s not in the studio as always, I&rsquo;m host Craig joined by Co host Taylor. Hey, special guest. So and we&rsquo;re breaking down Summer Slam 2025 and various major events recently in the. World of WWE as well. Right. We&rsquo;ll get around to Hulk Hogan, maybe and. The rest will be a surprise as Mark&rsquo;s mind wanders.
Taylor
John Cena.
Craig
Cena.
Marcus
We can&rsquo;t see him.
Craig
Let&rsquo;s start with overall thoughts of what you thought of summer in 25. What what is it is it? Is it a really key moment in the wrestling calendar?
Marcus
Summer Slam is considered the second most important. Premium live event of the year by WWE after Wrestle Mania Mania. Some people actually call it hot wrestle Mania because WrestleMania is on during early spring and summer. Slam is on during late summer.
Speaker
Yes.
Marcus
Over there. Obviously not over here. It&rsquo;s called the biggest part of the summer. And when, when my friends and I watched it, we were all rugged. Up in hoodies and puffer. Jackets. It was pretty good. It was the first ever two night summer slam because usually a premium live event only goes for one night, but because the roster the WWE has right now is really stacked.
Craig
Right, Yep.
Marcus
And Triple H she does the booking. Doesn&rsquo;t like doing 5 minute throw away matches. They have to cause most of the matches will go for around at least 10 minutes. The main event of night two this year went for well over 35 minutes so.
Craig
And is that long? Is that is it was the main event was considered? Kind of like a a great match. 35 minutes.
Marcus
Ohh, people thought this was great, so the main event of summer Slam 2025 was John Cena versus Cody Rhodes 2. Their first matches at WrestleMania and it wasn&rsquo;t very good because it&rsquo;s John Cena&rsquo;s retirement year and his final year as a wrestler. He turned heel, which means he became a villain at the start of the year because that&rsquo;s something he hasn&rsquo;t done in over 20 years. And he wanted to do that before he retired, and it was just a very odd. Ron and had some very mediocre matches.
Craig
Yes, right, right. Because it&rsquo;s so as you&rsquo;re saying, it&rsquo;s come to an end now, right, that he&rsquo;ll run.
Marcus
Yeah. And there was no, there was no great moment where he did a really heroic action. He just came out and smacked down one day, said he didn&rsquo;t want to be a bad guy anymore. And literally that was it. And yeah, it it&rsquo;s a really awkward promo because Cody&rsquo;s in the ring.
Craig
Really.
Speaker
That&rsquo;s the reason.
Marcus
Who is the the main guy right now? He lost the championship to senior and he got at WrestleMania, got it back at summer. Plan, but seeing it comes out has this long and rambling monologue about how someone pressured me into turning evil because he thought it would be good TV. The rock, the rock, Dwayne Johnson who influenced a lot of the storylines up until sort of March of this year and then just vanished. Without a trace.
Craig
Is there a reason why he&rsquo;s vanished? Is there much speculation as to what went down there?
Marcus
Two things. One is that Dwayne Johnson obviously has a really loaded schedule because not only is he an actor, but he also runs multiple businesses and he runs his own product. Company and as Marco Pierre White once said, you cannot criticise a man for going to work.
Taylor
But it&rsquo;s a good quote. It is a good.
Marcus
Quote but also so the the chief content Officer, Triple H who does the booking of WWE right now. He and the rock and don&rsquo;t get along. They haven&rsquo;t gotten along for the 30 years they&rsquo;ve known each other. They&rsquo;re not friends. They don&rsquo;t enjoy working together. And now that Triple H is and the main guy in head of Creative and Dwayne Johnson&rsquo;s the on the board of directors, they clash. And I think the rock just took his ball and.
Craig
Went home. Yeah, right. So. So the sense is that part of John Cena&rsquo;s heel turn heel. Babyface, move. Now is, is that this is an indication that the rocks influences gone gone.
Speaker
Yeah.
Marcus
Thank goodness, because it was. Everyone keeps waiting for him to turn up and he there&rsquo;s no word from him. They haven&rsquo;t even. Him, but the rematch was really good and it was it. It actually starts out with a really brilliant and subtle bit of storytelling, because the basis of seeing his heel turn was that he was going to ruin wrestling. And so instead of the regular like red, white and blue lights in the caricature of him saluting the comes up on the big screen when he does his entrance for the real run, it was just black text.
Craig
Right.
Marcus
Very black screen white text John Cena to indicate he&rsquo;s not messy. Going around, but when he made his interest summer slam, it starts with the black, the black background, the white text and then boom, the lights come up. It&rsquo;s red, white and blue. There&rsquo;s the character of him saluting, and the crowd absolutely exploded. They were so happy to have him as.
Craig
A good guy again caught everyone.
Marcus
By surprise, it didn&rsquo;t catch any everyone by surprise. I think that that decision. Because people were sort of umming and arring after Smackdown going. Is this real or is he actually gonna be a good guy again? But no, no, he&rsquo;s back as a good guy. And so and the rematch with Cody was excellent. It was a street fight. So notice qualifications, no countouts only win by pinfall or sub. Mission and it went with well over 35 minutes. They actually destroyed part of the ring trying to do damage to each other. There was no blood, which I thought was surprising. They had a really good brawl all throughout the the audience that went through the backstage area. There&rsquo;s this brilliant part where there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s an elevator that lifts Cody up as part of his entrance. Seeing a pounds on coat, he hoists him over his shoulders for his finishing move. The attitude adjustment and then goes backstage and comes out of the elevator with Cody still over his shoulders and this demonic grin and. Space. There&rsquo;s just a lot of really good camera movements and just a lot of really good character work as well. The body language of the guys was excellent, seen as body language, as a wrestler is one of his greatest assets because for, for, for years and years and years when he was doing his full time run, the audience would chant at him. You can&rsquo;t wrestle. You can&rsquo;t wrestle, but the way that he carries himself in his body language and his facial expressions are really good at communicating character and telling a story. And that was really on display in.
Craig
The straight fight, it still surprises me. The return to baby face happening so soon, because part of the excitement I guess for John scenes departure was this drama. Attic shift into a bad guy and that this was going to potentially. I mean there were a lot of speculation as how big this could become. You know, could it mean that all the wrestling titles are going to get taken by Cena and he&rsquo;ll he&rsquo;ll have to reset them or something?
Marcus
Or it would have been an interesting story that to follow, he could have unified. Onto the belts, but ultimately, you know, he&rsquo;s been a heel for five months. There&rsquo;s been a lot of discourse online about whether or not it&rsquo;s worked. If anyone&rsquo;s unfamiliar, wrestling is all. It&rsquo;s all scripted entertainment that presents itself. Being it it ohh, it&rsquo;s basically it. It&rsquo;s acknowledged as but as as as as a work of fiction outside of the outside of the premium live events and the TV shows with the TV shows and the premium live events still aren&rsquo;t operate under that mask grade, which is called kayfabe. And ultimately people are not buying it out of universe. They&rsquo;re not buying in and doing, they&rsquo;re still cheering him. He&rsquo;s been a hill. He was a hill for five months and he&rsquo;s only got about 5 months left.
Craig
Yeah. Before he&rsquo;s gone forever. So because you had a couple of memes that were getting generated by the Sinner, he&rsquo;ll turn the little boy. Who was crestfallen but loved being what was the story about the little boy right? He was like one of the events early on with seen as he&rsquo;ll turn.
Marcus
He was a kid in Brussels at the very front row, wearing in John Cena T shirt and John Cena hat, and it&rsquo;s just after the heel turn and seen it calls him out as part of because he comes out and goes. I&rsquo;ve been in an abusive relationship with all of you. People and he singles the kid out and then they just shot at the kid with his mouth hanging open and just staring like a deer in the headlights. And they actually found the kid in interview afterwards. He was like, look, I&rsquo;m aware that this is.
Craig
That&rsquo;s right.
Marcus
All scripted. I thought it was really cool that he involved me in the story.
Craig
And again, yeah, so it was the sense of really generating it. It&rsquo;s a huge impact. And again if if you&rsquo;re listening out there, feel free to send us a message on 0488811707. We&rsquo;re talking with our special guest Marcus about the Summer Slam 2025. We have a message in. On. Steam no one. What is? What is the chat?
Marcus
Steam steam Chat, my favourite messaging service.
Craig
What is that an image of I think.
Taylor
Isn&rsquo;t that YouTube? Yeah.
Craig
That&rsquo;s. OK YouTube. Chat. Are we playing a game by Big Boy Natty? Thanks, Big Boy needy listening in, he says. Good evening, doctor Craig TT.
Taylor
Yeah, that&rsquo;s maybe.
Craig
OK, that&rsquo;s you and special guest Marcus. Listening was playing cyberpunk. Well, I I think this will help. There&rsquo;s no wrestling in Cyberpunk 2070.
Speaker
Wow.
Taylor
7 There&rsquo;s straight fights.
Craig
In fight. Oh, that&rsquo;s. Right, yes you can. You can do street fighting. Yeah. So we&rsquo;re breaking down WrestleMania 2025. Have jumped in, I guess at one of the surprise favourite moment. Elements of night 2, but which is the Cody Rhodes and John Cena? They&rsquo;re both baby faces now. So what&rsquo;s the inward explanation of two baby faces fighting each other?
Marcus
They were fighting over the undisputed belt, which is seen as the most prestigious belt in the company, because Cody is still a full timer and he wants the belt back because he went through so much to get it in universe and out of universe as well and it was orange case if he wanted it back. And there&rsquo;s a brilliant moment and it it&rsquo;s made clear throughout the throughout the fight that it&rsquo;s not.
Speaker
Used to be.
Marcus
It&rsquo;s not personal it they just. It&rsquo;s just who&rsquo;s gonna be the real top dog. And there&rsquo;s a brilliant moment near the end where a big part of Cody&rsquo;s story in universe is he has to learn to be less soft and less forgiving. And there&rsquo;s a brilliant bit where he and I&rsquo;ve never seen this done before. He undoes Part 1 of the one of the ring. I don&rsquo;t even know. Like, like he full on takes a turn. Buckle off the ring and still attached to the ropes, and he starts bludgeoning. Tina with it, really. And the audience was actually booing him for cause. That&rsquo;s such a heel tactic, but it was very much a case. So I have to do whatever it takes to win. But there&rsquo;s a brilliant moment where he hits a bunch of his signature moves on scene and realises that he&rsquo;s about to pin scene her and put him down for good and.
Craig
What are the names of the signature moves?
Marcus
So for Cody, it&rsquo;s one of them is the Cody Carter where he jumps off, he runs towards and jumps off the second rope. And as he&rsquo;s as he&rsquo;s falling, he sort of grabs the other guys head and drops them to the mat.
Craig
The Cody cutter.
Marcus
Yeah, which is similar to the diamond cutter, which is DDP&rsquo;s signature. And the RKO, which is Randy Orton signature. Yeah, he also does the crossroads where he sort of hooks the other guys head underneath his armpit. So they&rsquo;re bent backwards at the knees and sort of flips around. So they slam the head on the mat. There&rsquo;s also the flip flop and fly, which is one of his dad&rsquo;s moves.
Craig
Flip flop and fly.
Marcus
Why? It&rsquo;s basically a bunch of a bunch of close range punches and then starts with him sort of spinning his hands like he&rsquo;s doing a disco dance from his knees as he bends over to the knees. Does that stands up, adjusts his head and then box them with an elbow? Oh gosh, flip the flip flop and fly.
Taylor
Flip flop and fly. Yeah, I knew it was slip, slop and slap.
Craig
Whoops. Slap, slap. See.
Marcus
Both really good marketing campaigns.
Speaker
Yeah.
Marcus
Those are those are the three big ones that you see in every Cody Rhodes.
Craig
And so you&rsquo;re describing a scene in the the match with Scener and Rhodes, where he is roads is doing his signature moves.
Marcus
Yeah. So he the to the, the, the climax of the match. He&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s hit them all scene is. Clearly staggered.
Craig
And I guess the crowds reacting to that as they&rsquo;re seeing these signature moves, each one of those is kind of narratively placed to to create heat or audience engagement. And so Sinner is. Is kind of receiving these moves, and the audiences, the audience.
Marcus
Cody is an interesting one because usually because the the the WWE audience is interesting in that the people, usually the they always dislike the current guy. They almost always dislike the current guy ever since. Yeah, ever since John Cena became the guy in the early 2000&rsquo;s, The people who were going to see him.
Craig
Everything&rsquo;s like the belt holder.
Marcus
Who had the disposable income to pay to go and see senior matches had grown up watching Brett Hart Stone cold and the rock, and they were the three guys. They loved and Sena was not like any of them. And so they would Boo him because they didn&rsquo;t like the way that he was portrayed as a, as a, as a as a hero. They didn&rsquo;t like his style, so they would just he&rsquo;d walk in and they would just absolutely Boo him out of the building. But now, because seeing was always be with kids watching at home. So now the people who are going to the stadiums to see the matches. People who were kids when they watched John Cena 10/15/20 years ago and so now they Boo whoever seen her as fighting cause they he&rsquo;s their childhood hero.
Craig
It&rsquo;s like the attack of the clones movie, you know? Ohh maybe Phantom menace, right? Absolutely horrible movies from ******** Star Wars. And but that was the movie The kids grew up with, and now it&rsquo;s a cherished part of Star Wars, which gets re released.
Marcus
Yeah.
Speaker
Really.
Taylor
I. Even though I thought everyone hated it matter who they were.
Craig
Not not young kids. I mean, I think that was aimed at.
Marcus
8 year olds I I loved phantom menace when I saw it in this and it. Was a nine year old I.
Craig
Saw it twice, right, see and and it&rsquo;s in this nice, warm nostalgic place. Now, if it&rsquo;s at the movies as a.
Marcus
Relaunch or I will say I&rsquo;ve never liked to tackle the clones though. I&rsquo;ve. Always found that. Boring start now, yeah.
Taylor
Me too.
Craig
Come to the converted here.
Marcus
But something that&rsquo;s something to note is that is that Cody is the first guy who&rsquo;s actually like being an organic baby face, who the crowd actually likes because he usually gets the really big cheers like everyone sings, sings his theme song. They get behind everything that he does. They&rsquo;re always cheering for like. Nuts for him. Because from sort of 2002 to him coming back in 2022. The main guys were people who Vince McMahon, the former owner, would just push. He just didn&rsquo;t care what the audience thought cause he was a strange and odd dude, and we have something to say about him in a little bit. A strange and odd dude who just hated his audience for some reason I thought they.
Craig
Were all idiots, but Vince McMahon is the is is the godfather of.
Taylor
The son of the Godfather.
Craig
The space, the sound of it, yeah.
Marcus
Really. No. He McMahon like McMahon. Senior ran a successful run, a successful territory.
Craig
Because we&rsquo;re talking here about the managers and bosses, yeah.
Marcus
Junior.
Craig
Of wrestling, WWF, WWE.
Marcus
Yeah. Insane. You run a run a successful territory, Vince Junior. Who was that? That guy ran a successful global takeover.
Taylor
Fair.
Marcus
Vincent Vincent. Major is human scum. He&rsquo;s an atrocious human being, personally. But he did succeed in making the.
Craig
Bought out.
Marcus
Ohh yeah. Ohh yeah, the one where he&rsquo;s like in tears when he&rsquo;s being asked about what? His what his friendship with. The undertaking. Means he&rsquo;s. Yeah. Because because, well, because. Because he was horribly abused as a kid. He hates any involuntary bodily function. So he hates crying because he can&rsquo;t control it. He&rsquo;s fired people for sneezing in front of him. He hates anything you can&rsquo;t control.
Craig
Gosh, seems like an episode of succession or something.
Marcus
Pretty much is, but there was a really controversial moment from the end of the end of the match, or just after the.
Craig
Match rather. Yep, this is Day 2, the Cody versus. Seen a match.
Marcus
Yes. So it ends with Cody gets the pin. After saluting scene. It looks really sad. He salutes him cause like they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re friends in real life. They&rsquo;re friends in the fictional.
Craig
Saluting Cena. That&rsquo;s.
Speaker
Yeah.
Marcus
Universe and it&rsquo;s like he wants his belt back. He doesn&rsquo;t want his friend, so he pins him. He gets the belt back. There&rsquo;s tears. They hug scene. It gives him the belt. Seen her motions to Cody for the audience to applaud for him. Cody gets out of the ring and let&rsquo;s see now have his moment. The audience is chanting. Thank you, Cena. But then. A wrestler who was one of seen his big rivals throughout his career, his music hits and he comes out and it&rsquo;s Brock Lesnar who? OK. So Vince Junior, who we just talked about who ran WWE for about 4045 years, had to resign because he&rsquo;s being investigated by the feds for running a sex trafficking. Yes, and Brock Lesnar was 100% complicit in that. And there are text messages confirming this and he he&rsquo;s mysteriously disappeared after Mania after summer Slam 2023 with we&rsquo;d never seen him again. And Brock Lesnar comes out and he&rsquo;s here to have one last match against Cena later in the year, and that has inspired opinions online.
Craig
Wow. Yeah. I mean, that&rsquo;s a really. The toxic move to bring.
Marcus
That&rsquo;s someone you do not want, especially considering how many women are in the WWE right now like they&rsquo;re women&rsquo;s roster is the biggest it&rsquo;s ever been. You do not want someone who is involved in a human trafficking organisation. It&rsquo;s difficult to be a wrestling fan at the moment because of stuff like that.
Craig
So who&rsquo;s the who&rsquo;s the target audience for this? I mean, this would have to have gone through some marketing to decide. Alright, well, let&rsquo;s bring. Back he&rsquo;s got the right wing neo-Nazi audience.
Marcus
My my understanding is my understanding is that it was done as a favour to John Cena because Cena Cassina enjoyed working with Brock Lesnar throughout his career and so my understanding is that he&rsquo;s actually requested that Lesnar come back so he can have.
Speaker
Really.
Marcus
One last last match again.
Craig
Even with the bad PR optics I.
Marcus
Could be very wrong. I could be very wrong but. That that&rsquo;s my understanding.
Craig
No. So these, they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re. Yeah. So there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s juicy behind the scenes. Debates and conspiracy.
Taylor
And and for people at home who haven&rsquo;t seen Brock Lesnar, he looks kind of like if he had fantastic fours. The thing as just a human, that&rsquo;s him.
Marcus
If you were to cover if you were to cover a tree like an oak tree trunk in shaved ham, that&rsquo;s Brock Lesnar.
Craig
Wow. Wow. So yeah, look, I mean, it is. It&rsquo;s surprising then that that this, this, I mean polarising figure or this.
Marcus
Seems polarising cause people who grew up watching him are like, yeah, Brock Lesnar&rsquo;s back. And then people who are aware that he is involved in an ongoing human trafficking.
Craig
Just like.
Marcus
It&rsquo;s like, why would you bring him back? That&rsquo;s a really bad. That&rsquo;s bad. Pay off. And they&rsquo;ve they&rsquo;ve gotten bad PR as a result. It&rsquo;s really upsetting.
Craig
Well this I. Mean. I mean, I mean, there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s been some discussion of the the overlap between the Trump administration and WWE. Maybe this is just part of being on the the bandwagon of trying to dig yourself out of implications with sex.
Marcus
Trafficking. Well, I mean, Trump is a WWE Hall of Famer, so I mean, obviously the standards are low.
Craig
By being a Hall of Fame, what does that mean? He&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s a photo of him in a museum. The wrestling museum, yeah.
Marcus
No, he&rsquo;s well, he&rsquo;s been stunned by Stone Cold Steve Austin so that he&rsquo;s technically been he&rsquo;s been part of wrestling manoeuvres. But yeah, so the Hall of Fame happens every year at WrestleMania. Basically. They induct people, they get updated with speech. There&rsquo;s a video package celebrating their life and accomplishments. And yeah, Trump&rsquo;s. A Hall of Famer, he got inducted a few years.
Craig
Ago and that would be like a university giving an honorary degree to Shane Warne or something, right? Like it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a way of.
Marcus
Absolutely.
Craig
Of of ensuring political links as well as. You know real. Wrestlers being recognised, but it also has a heavy political. Space. It&rsquo;s wrestling, right wing, conservative.
Marcus
It would be it&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s a that&rsquo;s a. That&rsquo;s a question there have been periods where it&rsquo;s been extremely conservative. So during the war.
Craig
Or.
Marcus
Terror. They had a character played by an Italian American called Mohammed Hassan. One who wears extremely stereotypical Middle Eastern clothing and his he was he. He was a bad guy. No, not not the Sheikh, it&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s the farmer from the Sheikh. He was playing a character who was he was a villain cause he was upset at how much anti Islamic sentiment there was following the War on Terror. And that&rsquo;s why he was a bad guy. And so a lot of people these days pretend that that never happened. There have been a lot of really questionable depictions of LGBTQIA plus people. The character gold dust was basically created to tap into gay panic in the mid to late 1990.
Craig
Wow. So at the height of the AIDS crisis, height, but certainly within that.
Marcus
Yeah, well. They have this very androgynous character in a body suit who licks his lips and lusts openly, lusts after the other men on the roster, and it&rsquo;s just.
Craig
Well, your decade was.
Marcus
That nine this was like 969798, it&rsquo;s.
Craig
Right, right, right.
Taylor
Has Joe Biden in the Hall of Fame? Has he ever had an attitude adjustment?
Craig
Are there any? Yeah, left wing progressive.
Marcus
Ohh look though, I mean Mohammed Mohammed Ali is in the the Hall of Fame.
Craig
The wrestling. Yeah, right.
Marcus
Because he&rsquo;s he was the I think he was a guest enforcer, the guest ring announcer? No, the I think it was a referee for the for main event. Marissa Mania 1. He was involved in that.
Speaker
See.
Taylor
Yeah, it&rsquo;s good referee. Yeah.
Craig
Because Hulk Hogan. Of course, notoriously at the end of his life, promoted and campaigned for Trump. Yep, and a lot of that came up in his obituaries as a some people head scratching kind of identity shift. So within these, did you?
Marcus
Just just on the note of that, after Hulk Hogan passed away, the Wrestling Observer newsletter, which is seen as being sort of the foremost weekly publication wrestling in the world, the the the week he passed away, they did a Life and Times issue and the following week they actually reported on some of the responses his death had gotten online. Because Hulk Hogan was, he was recorded saying some extremely racist things that got leaked, and he&rsquo;s also, you know, a Trump supporter, A notorious backstage politicker. Obviously, he helped make wrestling really big in the 80s, but also.
Speaker
So.
Marcus
Generally speaking, bit of a sketchy guy, scrappy, strange, strange history with his family and basically anyone who said any public figure who said anything about Hulk Hogan would get criticised by someone in the weeks after he passed away. If you were progressive and you said that he had a complicated legacy because of his racism and the way he treated his family, you&rsquo;d get flamed by his fans saying you don&rsquo;t know your wrestling history, there wouldn&rsquo;t be a WrestleMania.
Taylor
Yeah, here&rsquo;s a moustache.
Marcus
If it wasn&rsquo;t for him, whereas if he was lauded by people who are mega fans and appreciated things that he done done for the the the industry, then you&rsquo;d have progressives saying he was a racist. Then he was a political and he was terrible to his family. You you. You shouldn&rsquo;t be celebrating his accomplishments. And I&rsquo;m. I&rsquo;m not saying that either of those are correct or incorrect statements, but he just the amount of vitriol that was directed towards anyone who said anything about him in the weeks following his death was astounding.
Speaker
Hmm.
Taylor
That he&rsquo;s just Twitter as well.
Marcus
Twitter. Some some people actually got some people got bullied off social media like Joey Swoll, who&rsquo;s thing is he&rsquo;s on Instagram and he basically tries to have really positive messages to people and tried to dispel, like any toxic beliefs said that he was a huge fan of Hulk Hogan and people flamed him with within an inch of his life. And he actually quit Instagram for a few days.
Taylor
Yeah.
Speaker
Next.
Marcus
Like I can&rsquo;t take it. Gun.
Craig
Because he said he was a.
Marcus
Fan because he said he was a fan of Hulk Hogan growing up.
Craig
And the backlash to that?
Marcus
Was from, from, from, from progressives who were like he was a racist. He was a terrible human. You can&rsquo;t say stuff like this.
Craig
Because I guess one of the other aspects of Hulk Hogan&rsquo;s past I&rsquo;d forgotten about was his involvement in the Gorka. The scandal with the sex tape and how that complete I&rsquo;ve forgotten about the media systems that basically dismantled the payout was huge. Yeah, I forget how.
Marcus
Ohh yeah. Many it was 115,000,000 that the courts ordered to him. He I think he I believe he settled for 32,000,000.
Craig
Millions, but. And I&rsquo;m 15 really well. Because it was a defamation case, I imagine, and it was because they&rsquo;d.
Speaker
Yeah.
Craig
Used the sex footage that had leaked, OK.
Marcus
I believe it was the footage of him saying how much he hates African Americans that.
Craig
Got leaked? Ohh right it was. That. And anyway, that that that resulted in the collapse of that media platform and that rippled throughout a lot of other platforms. Even Kotaku, you know that there was not a, Kotaku told the journalist, was just saying, you know. He was there, involved not in Gawker but adjacent media publishing company, and was shocked at the ripples that created. So OK. That&rsquo;s Hulk Hogan, so storyline. So we&rsquo;ve we&rsquo;ve gone through a little bit of the storylines in terms of. Sena. What are some of the ongoing storylines which are are kind of becoming compelling at the moment or which we&rsquo;re seeing emerge now or or getting wrapped?
Marcus
Up one story that&rsquo;s had a a a curveball that was really well done is so the whole. The the Seth Rollins CM Punk feud, which has been going off and on since CM Punk came back in late 2023. For reference, CM Punk is someone who was he? He left WWE in 2014 under a cloud of controversy, spent the next nine years saying very negative things about them and then was welcomed back with open arms. Seth Rollins, basically. That the ball from him is being one of the top guys and has never had a nice thing to say about punk in real life or in kayfabe. And essentially, there&rsquo;s a story been going on between them for a while now. They had they had a triple threat match at WrestleMania, which ended with Seth Rollins turning heel. Even the audience loves him, became a bad guy, and he started his own faction called The Vision. And this is brilliant. So they so LA night, who was another guy who people. Really like him. And it&rsquo;s really it&rsquo;s basically do or die time either because he&rsquo;s 42, he&rsquo;s not getting any younger either they. No, he&rsquo;s 40. Sorry. Either they strap the rocket to him and make him one of the top guys or he&rsquo;s gonna flounder in the mid kite for forever cause even though.
Speaker
Right.
Marcus
Wrestling is premeditated. People only have so much time that they can be in the main event, and it&rsquo;s got you&rsquo;ve gotta capitalise because it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s week to week. There is no offseason for wrestling and he&rsquo;s he challenged Seth Rollins to a match at Saturday night&rsquo;s main event and during the match Seth has a history of knee injuries. He did WrestleMania last year on a torn meniscus. He was working on one leg and he had two matches across the weekend, plus a run in and then he had several months off for surgery during the match at Saturday night&rsquo;s main event.
Craig
Ouch.
Marcus
Broadcast live on NBC because normally wrestling&rsquo;s done either on a streaming service or cable, he does his knee and he very and this is brilliant. He he he injured his knee. He looks terrified and he very clearly motions over to the referee and you can clearly see him telling her go and tell Ellie night to pin me. Done my knee. I can&rsquo;t keep doing the match. So he&rsquo;s called. He&rsquo;s called an audible. That&rsquo;s what that&rsquo;s called. Because if you can&rsquo;t continue with the match, you&rsquo;ve got to communicate to the other person and say, here&rsquo;s what we have to do. And so Seth Rollins is then on crutches. There&rsquo;s word he&rsquo;s gonna be out for six or seven months. And here&rsquo;s the thing. Seth Rollins won money in the bank, which basically means that if you have the money, the bank briefcase whenever you want, you can open it and you can, if you pin the tile, you can. You can get an immediate title match no matter where you are or where you are. And it&rsquo;s always done on TV, even though there&rsquo;s so many other hours in the week because it&rsquo;s WWE and. Their their universe is interesting, but essentially so. There was talk about how how they&rsquo;re going to do this when he&rsquo;s going to be out until next year. Yeah. And then there&rsquo;s much the night 1 main event is CM Punk, his rival versus Gunther dead in general, whose thing is that? He&rsquo;s Hitler. And he Gunther has the World Heavyweight Championship, which is the main belt on Roy. It&rsquo;s the secondary world title of the promotion. And it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s an exhausting.
Speaker
MHM.
Marcus
Match Punk is on his knees, gassed for most of it, and it&rsquo;s clearly done in storyline that he&rsquo;s really exhausted fighting Gunther and he basically, Gunther&rsquo;s only been pinned 3 times in the since he&rsquo;s gone to W. Anyway, and he punk basically makes him bleed for the first time he sends him over the announcers desk. Good. That comes back with his face covered in blood, cause he&rsquo;s done a. Really impressive blade. Job play Joe Punk gets him back in the ring, pins him clean as a whistle. He&rsquo;s got the World Heavyweight championship. It&rsquo;s his moment and then Seth theme music hits Seth.
Craig
&lsquo;S right.
Marcus
Comes out on crutches, throws the crutches away, undoes his leg brace, prances around, pulls out his briefcase, sprints to the ring, pins punk for the 123 and now says the. Heavyweight champion. And the following Rd. The first person to come out and start mouthing off during during a word battle and challenge for a title fight is Ella. Knight. That guy who he injured his knee again to quote unquote. And they have a match later that night that ends in his qualification cause CM Punk gets involved. So this whole punk and LA night are both going after Seth and they are going to feud with each other at. Some point soon.
Craig
Right. Wow.
Marcus
And this storyline is juicy. This has been probably the second best storyline of the year in my estimate, because it&rsquo;s been going for so long through so many permutations. There are so many people involved. The faction that that&rsquo;s built is brilliant the other.
Speaker
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Marcus
Man, sorry. So that&rsquo;s that. And that&rsquo;s really cool. This other thing, which is really funny, is that one of the other top guys, Roman Reigns, he he&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s often out for months at a time. 1 of Seth henchman. Bronson Reed hits this, he he he speared Roman Reigns so hard in an episode of RAW that Roman Reigns his. Shoes came off.
Craig
That means I think. You&rsquo;ve.
Marcus
Died. And then what he does is Bronson Reed, who&rsquo;s a villain. Roman Reigns is a good guy. Bronson Reed steals these really nice Air Jordans, ties the laces together, and he starts wearing them around his neck. And because Roman Reigns, he&rsquo;s Samoan. He was. His role was the try, his his character with the tribal chief who&rsquo;s got this really nice red shell necklace called the ULA Fala. And so now Bronson Reed with these stolen shoes wears them around his neck, and they&rsquo;re the Shula Fala and the audience chants at him and everything. And it&rsquo;s brilliant.
Craig
Crazy.
Marcus
And so just just the fact that a pair of air. Ordnance has become this massive symbol of disrespect is.
Craig
Brilliant. And that would be a real. Surprise movement shoes flying off.
Speaker
Yes.
Craig
And then the wrestler being able to improvise a total amount of that.
Marcus
I don&rsquo;t know if it was improvised or not because people, but I mean people have been actually knocked out of their shoes before, so it wouldn&rsquo;t surprise me, but they had A tag match. Bronson Reed, sorry. Bronson Reed and Roman Reigns had a match against each other with other people involved at at summer slam. It was also really good. Lot of comedy in that match. There&rsquo;s a lot of really good comedy in WWE.
Craig
Right.
Marcus
Right now, but the yeah, the the punk night, Rollins conflicts coming out of me is one of the best ones. That that was a really enjoyable moment, and especially because they had played this fake injury, cause they&rsquo;re usually very clear. They&rsquo;re usually very clear about what is fake and what is real. It&rsquo;s.
Craig
Yeah, right. Someone was playing as.
Marcus
Just. Real they were playing it as real because people have been injured and they&rsquo;ve had to just stop batches this year and some, like there&rsquo;s one where I think it&rsquo;s Zoe Stark comes off a rope. The person she&rsquo;s called out to has noticed and she lands, finding her knees pointing a different angle. Uh. That was against.
Craig
Again and again the the wrestler would get the referee to help communicate.
Marcus
Yes, thankfully that was a triple threat match. So she left the other two kept on brawling and then and that was that was Kyrie saying who was involved in that. And then a couple weeks later, Kyrie saying having a match against Liv Morgan does a perfectly safe headlock. Take down and live. Morgan dislocates her shoulder. And so poor old Kyrie saying has now injured two people in the space of a fortnight and she. So they&rsquo;re both out of the rest of the year. So and because Seth&rsquo;s knee problems, his real life knee problems are so well documented that everyone thought it was real, I thought it was real. I got sucker. We got worked, brother. And so the fact that they were able to, he actually talked about in interviews about how he had to, because he was obviously he was fine at home. He&rsquo;s got a four year old daughter and he said to his daughter, we have to pretend that daddy&rsquo;s got a Boo Boo on his knee. Every I gotta make believe people need to believe this. So of course she immediately went to play school and told her teacher. About it.
Craig
And my dad said we have to make out. My dad&rsquo;s going to. What did you mean by you got worked? Is that a wrestling parlance for effectively being?
Marcus
As in. In, in wrestling work is, it&rsquo;s part of the script. Shoot is. It&rsquo;s real, right?
Craig
So by saying you&rsquo;re worked it was. A scripted moment.
Marcus
And we believed it.
Craig
That it it played as real and it was designed to play as real effectively, but it was actually setting up key fabe, yes. Lane story building. Because yes, that that would be fantastic. I&rsquo;m on the other storylines. How&rsquo;s the Australian talent?
Marcus
Ohh Ria bloody Ripley.
Craig
Because she was on night 1.
Speaker
Some.
Marcus
She was she opened night two night and and ah, because you know that triple threat match from the side of night 2 of WrestleMania earlier in the year. Yes. Similar thing where. She had an absolute bond burner at evolution, which was the second all women&rsquo;s premium life. And against the then world champion EO Sky that ends in Naomi, who had money, the bank major villain comes out, cashes in, gets CEO&rsquo;s title because they&rsquo;re doing this whole bit about how Rio Ripley&rsquo;s Rio Ripley has never beaten Neo Sky, and she still hasn&rsquo;t.
Craig
Right. Sky right. That&rsquo;s the Japanese wrestler.
Marcus
Yes, considered one of the great and. Man ohh sorry I have to have a little rant here. I understand that the the last 40 minutes has not been nothing but me ranting, but Triple H is really bad at booking champions to defend their titles. So there was a brilliant story just before Mania where here sky Beats Rear Ripley for the belt on raw. Very rare to see. A well titled Change Hands on an episode of TV. Usually it&rsquo;s a premium live. Based on in Kayfabe, a match that Ria suggested, she then defends it the following week and then she successfully everyone thought because there was a triple threat. Osmania with RIA and iOS Sky and another wrestler, Bianca Bel Air, everyone thought EO Sky was going to lose it cause she was the 3rd wheel on the feud. Everyone was disrespecting her. She pulls out this incredible win five Star match from the Wrestling Observer newsletter. Brilliant. Feel good. Brilliant. Feel good moment. She then does not defend the belt once.
Craig
Well, it&rsquo;s like.
Marcus
Between late April and when she loses it in mid July.
Craig
Really so just wasted storyline.
Marcus
Completely all there are so many women on that roster who she could have had really good title defences against, even if it&rsquo;s only on TV and not on Premier Live event, but they just didn&rsquo;t do it. She had non title matches, she was in tag team matches but they just didn&rsquo;t.
Craig
I know you&rsquo;ve mentioned in the past that you know Vince McMahon never knew what to do with someone who didn&rsquo;t speak English effectively as a wrestler. Is that partially to do with it still, sadly.
Marcus
Yeah. Or I wouldn&rsquo;t. I wouldn&rsquo;t say so. Because she&rsquo;s had incredible. She&rsquo;s had she, her previous world title run, which was a last year. It went for the best part of eight months. That was actually really good. And she had a number of feuds, feuds rather, and another of the new, one of the there are a couple of talent at the moment who aren&rsquo;t native English speakers, but one of the biggest wrestlers right now, Stephanie Vaquer. She was on NXT, which is the developmental brand, she&rsquo;s Chilean. She doesn&rsquo;t speak much English, but she had a really good run.
Speaker
Hmm.
Marcus
On as champion, actually a double champion, she had the world title and the North American title, so that&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s definitely.
Craig
Because it is. Changed. Yeah, it is exciting with the kind of lucha Libre style from Mexico and then the Japanese wrestling style. So, so definitely giving those global wrestling identities. Coverage in WWE can&rsquo;t help but benefit it, but yeah, it is. Unfortunate that. So anyway, in summer slam there was the match with rear and ear. And was that a good match was.
Marcus
That good? Yes, it was. Rear versus euro versus Naomi, who&rsquo;s sort of the main villain of the women&rsquo;s division at the moment. It was a good triple threat match. Naomi retained because she has a match against Stephanie.
Speaker
It was.
Marcus
Occur at the care at Clash in Paris later. This month and. If Stephanie occurs A babyface, people really like her. If you were to have her go against Rhea Ripley, people would start to Boo her, so she has to go against a mega heel so that people still like her. It&rsquo;s an interesting I actually got to thinking though, because they&rsquo;re gonna have crown jewel, one of the major premium live events in Australia this year. And so I.
Craig
Really, it&rsquo;s coming to Australia, it&rsquo;s. Wrestling.
Marcus
Yeah, it&rsquo;s normally in Saudi Arabia, but it&rsquo;s gonna be in. WA this year.
Craig
Wow, what&rsquo;s stray?
Taylor
Is there? There was already one in WA at some point.
Marcus
Wasn&rsquo;t there? That was elimination chamber last year.
Craig
Wow, OK, so this is happening in Australia. What&rsquo;s the hype for it? Are you excited? Are.
Taylor
Chamber, yeah.
Craig
You got your tickets, are you?
Marcus
Tickets are like 5000 bucks. Man, I&rsquo;m.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
Not going and it&rsquo;s just five audience for this.
Speaker
Easy.
Craig
It&rsquo;s not the legal or it&rsquo;s the rich local.
Marcus
Wrestling at the moment is it&rsquo;s in its third major boom period. Third major global boom period after the after the rock and wrestling era in the 80s and the Attitude era in the late late 90s, early 2000s. And there are a lot of people who were huge fans in Australia and there would be a market to fill up a a 100,000 person stadium there, not before they did it for. Nation chamber because it&rsquo;s what, 22?
Craig
Million people, certainly a market, but it&rsquo;s.
Marcus
Expensive. Ohh, it&rsquo;s. And that&rsquo;s the reason why they one of the reasons why they post that every every single show they do is they&rsquo;re most profitable ever because they just Jack up the prices to diculous levels. They are so expensive it&rsquo;s $500 to sit in the gods. I&rsquo;m not sitting at the back of the stadium for 500 bucks.
Craig
Why is it so? Really. Yeah. Managed meeting.
Marcus
And travelling to Westminster, no. No, no, no. Wow.
Taylor
But they but they had the really big stars coming to Australia as well for that one, it wasn&rsquo;t just. Like randoms or like the lowest ones, it was the highest ones as well. That&rsquo;s why the price.
Marcus
Is so big. Yeah. And scene is gonna be at the WA one as. Well.
Taylor
Yeah.
Marcus
He&rsquo;s gonna be at crown.
Craig
Right, I said.
Marcus
Jewel. OK.
Craig
Sorry guys, it&rsquo;s going to be huge events. It&rsquo;s going to be enormous, but it&rsquo;s unlikely to be something that apart from if you enter a competition. You&rsquo;ll be able to.
Marcus
Get into it all depends about how and how much you&rsquo;re doing, I suppose. Yeah. I mean, I.
Craig
Space.
Marcus
I could afford it though. I just.
Craig
Is this? I mean is it gonna have a stream flavour to it? Are we gonna have? Rio Ripley appearing and recruiting for we&rsquo;re gonna have a little legal talent.
Marcus
Well, she was the main event at the last one that they had cause normally at the elimination chamber, because that&rsquo;s a six person match. Normally the men&rsquo;s elimination chamber would be the main event, the one that goes on last. But no, when when it was in WA last it was her defending her title and she was she went on last so I reckon she&rsquo;ll get the title.
Speaker
Yeah.
Marcus
Back at. At Crown Jewel in WA, because if she gets the title back in her home country, the pop is going to be enormous, people are going to go wild.
Craig
She&rsquo;s 8. Well, well, the Australian tourism body be kind of jumping on this and attempting to promote crocodiles or something. Or like like.
Taylor
So do you mean like bluey and hammer?
Craig
Bar. Yeah. And someone in a bluey costume. I wonder what those soft power optics will be.
Taylor
This is going to be some sort of.
Craig
For and like you know you got Formula One, you got various global sporting events that come to Australia. Australia works hard to secure and then sometimes states compete with each other to get those rights like Formula One was in Adelaide. And then no one wanted.
Taylor
If we had a stadium, they could do. It here. That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m.
Craig
Thinking should we speak?
Marcus
Ma&rsquo;am.
Craig
Local PM about that stadium and wrestling.
Marcus
I gotta say it&rsquo;s sad that Jake the snake Roberts is with AW because, like, think of all the all the Australian snakes you could handle if.
Speaker
Oh.
Marcus
He was your WA.
Craig
OK. So the other thing when I was doing homework for the episode was I came across some discussion of some of the things that didn&rsquo;t go according to plan at at the show. Oh no. I know there was some disappointment. That the what is it? The cable ties didn&rsquo;t work on one of the.
Marcus
Events. Yeah, there was a sequence in the Lyra of Alqueria versus Becky Lynch match, where Lynch pulls out a toolbox because it&rsquo;s notice qualification pulls out zip. Ties cable ties Larry Valkyries hands together. They&rsquo;re obviously very loosely tied, but you know it&rsquo;s you. Understand what I&rsquo;ve done it. And there&rsquo;s a bit where her hands just come out of the cable ties and she just freaks out and puts them back in.
Speaker
Hmm.
Craig
And what would you I mean? To keep the K. 5 Going you want to try to do it off camera? Yeah. But she was on.
Marcus
Camera, right. She&rsquo;s Laura. Valkyria is quite is. She&rsquo;s it. It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s only her first year on the main roster, so she&rsquo;s not used to.
Craig
Right.
Marcus
Revising was what she should have done. She should have just gotten out of them and, you know, called Becky over and they could redo the sport or something along those lines. But basically.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
She didn&rsquo;t wanna not follow the script. Yeah. And is that also the kind of anxiety in the fandom around that do is that kind of like, wow, you know, this is the problem with with wrestling. Now it&rsquo;s all on script or something. Is there a debate? Around what that reflects.
Marcus
Absolutely. That&rsquo;s 100% a complaint that a lot of modern, a lot of older fans have that have with that in the modern era.
Craig
30 years ago this, or 40 years ago, this would be.
Speaker
Yeah.
Marcus
It used to be you&rsquo;d write out a couple of like major story beats and then you&rsquo;d just improvise everything in the ring. One of the really famous examples of that happening is Summer Slam 1992, the Intercontinental Championship between Bret Hart and Davey Boy Smith, his brother in law, Davey Boy Smith had just come off all week long crack binge and he was on a massive crack cocaine downer and he pulls Bret Hart over in front of 92,000. People and he goes. Brett, I&rsquo;m fooked. I can&rsquo;t remember the March and Brett Hart goes. Don&rsquo;t worry about it. DV. I&rsquo;ll carry you. Just follow my lead. Hey. And so Brett Hart literally. Has to. There are so many that match is like at like a 9 1/2 out of 10 near perfect match considered the greatest Summer Slam match of all time. But there are so many rest holds because Brett Hart has to keep reminding Davey Boy Smith what he has to do next. And then Davey Boy wins at the end so hard.
Craig
Right.
Marcus
Carried that man and.
Craig
Yeah. Yeah. So any other surprise moments or things in the summer slam?
Marcus
There was 1 moment. So there&rsquo;s a wrestler carrying cross and his wife Scarlett Bordeaux. Both of them have been on the roster for a while. They haven&rsquo;t really had too many matches recently cause Carrie&rsquo;s basically The thing is, he&rsquo;s the corrupter. Right. His thing is he shows up and he&rsquo;s he&rsquo;ll try to corrupt a baby face and he will have his hair done in their hairstyle. That&rsquo;s his thing. And it&rsquo;s been knowledge all year that his contract is coming to an end and he&rsquo;s good mates with a lot of people on the roster. And so they tried to give him a really big push and give him some major matches on PL E and the fans have responded to this quite nicely and they were actually throughout the his math throughout other matches changing we want. Cross we want cross and in the post show. True, Triple H said. Did you hear those saying we want Brock? We want Brock and carrying cross and skull board. Those contracts expired earlier this week and they&rsquo;re not being rehired. They&rsquo;re now in the alumni section on the website. And so Triple H is actually no last week rather so trips is trying to basically convert the narrative of the audience calling out for carrying. Just to get rehired and say, oh, it&rsquo;s about Brock Lesnar. And so that was.
Craig
Not quite. All right, hold on the stream. &lsquo;S going weird.
Taylor
It is I&rsquo;m. I&rsquo;m just trying to. I&rsquo;m just trying to figure out if it&rsquo;s behind or. Anything that&rsquo;s cool.
Speaker
What?
Marcus
Ohh I&rsquo;ll tell you. I&rsquo;ll tell you a surprise that I had the Becky versus Valkyria match that we talked about just before the the intercontinent the the, the women&rsquo;s intercontinental about where the you know the the the zip tie is not working. Yes, I thought because that was their third match and I thought for certain that Laura Valkyrie was going to win that cause she was the hero with the feud. Ohh. Green screen.
Craig
I&rsquo;ll put my laptop camera.
Marcus
As I thought the entire few because she was the inaugural champion, they they had a. Match. She beats Becky. They have a rematch. Becky beats hers. So this is the third match after a triple threat match at evolution, which had Bailey in it as well. Who&rsquo;s the 3rd member of this story? Essentially. And I thought for certain liars gotta win. Baby face comes out on top now because she&rsquo;s very new. But he&rsquo;s been around for a very long time. Surely she&rsquo;ll come out on top. She&rsquo;ll be a made woman. And then Becky Lynch won IW. What that I did not expect. So we have we have our we have our bad guy wins ending and Becky is going to continue to terrorise the rest of the women&rsquo;s division. I thought I did not.
Craig
Expect that at all. So in terms of what&rsquo;s happening next in WB, what&rsquo;s the next big thing that we should start getting ready for?
Marcus
Clash in Paris, 31st of August.
Craig
Oh, that&rsquo;s in.
Marcus
Paris, yes. Which is really the 1st of September for us. So the confirmed matches thus far are John Cena versus Logan Paul.
Craig
Really, Logan? Paul. Logan. Paul.
Taylor
Wow, nice.
Craig
I mean, he&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s fit, right. He&rsquo;s not there as a joke.
Taylor
He said, yeah, he&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s pretty good at it.
Marcus
The man is a. The man is a superb performer. He&rsquo;s. Great athlete.
Craig
Yeah. And he is, of course, going to play a hero or he is a hero. He&rsquo;s the bad guy.
Marcus
He doesn&rsquo;t. Yeah. Yeah, he doesn&rsquo;t play a heel. He is heel.
Taylor
Yeah.
Marcus
So they they&rsquo;ve thrown it.
Craig
Well, that&rsquo;s a big that&rsquo;s. You know, reflects on how Big Luke and Paul is. I guess that he&rsquo;s given this match against Cena in his last year.
Speaker
OK.
Marcus
Yeah, it&rsquo;s like and it&rsquo;s because one of the criticisms about criticisms about seeing his retirement tour is that he&rsquo;s mostly fighting guys he fought 1015 years ago. Yeah. So the it&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s only had a couple of matches against the new talent and this is the most new talent he&rsquo;s had a match against because generally speaking, it&rsquo;s an unwritten rule for wrestlers that you lose your last match.
Craig
Really.
Marcus
Against younger talent to make them look.
Craig
Good. Who do you think that&rsquo;s gonna get set up?
Marcus
For this year, I could not tell you. All I know is that scene as last match is gonna be in Boston. It&rsquo;s gonna be a Saturday night main event, so it will be broadcast on NBC and YouTube. And I think if he loses in Boston, then there&rsquo;s. Going to be a riot.
Craig
Alright. Right. So they might have to not go to convention.
Marcus
Yeah, because there are. There are very few times where a wrestler will win their their final match. I mean there was the match that stone cold had against Kevin Owens a couple of years ago. It was Stone Cold&rsquo;s first match in 19 years and he won because it was in Texas. And if he had lost, there would have been a riot and. Someone would try to kill Kevin Owens. Sting won his retirement match, but that was mostly because he&rsquo;d spent 35 years getting messed around by terrible creative. Goldberg lost his retirement match in Atlanta to Gunther earlier in the year, and then it was a terrific match. Then he went online and criticised it because NBC cut off his retirement speech. Like, bro, it&rsquo;s on YouTube. Just go to the WWE channel. Just be grateful you gotta retire the match. Be grateful you gotta retire the match, unlike. Bret Hart, whose career you ended when you nearly kicked his head.
Craig
Right. It&rsquo;s.
Marcus
But sorry, straying from the point of the matches that are going to be there, that&rsquo;s going to be fatal four way for the World Heavyweight Championship, which is gonna, which is the main belt on raw, it&rsquo;s going to be between Seth Rollins, he&rsquo;s got the belt, CM Punk, LA Night and.
Craig
This is the big one. You&rsquo;re just setting. Up the storyline.
Marcus
And also Jay USO, who had the belt earlier in the year and everyone loves him because of his theme song and they&rsquo;re setting up Cody Rhodes versus Drew McIntyre. Drew McIntyre is one of the best performers they have is he is a monster heel in the ring. He basically he&rsquo;s a Scottish warlord, essentially.
Taylor
True.
Marcus
And he he&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s built like a brick house. He&rsquo;s got the evil beard, the menacing eyebrows. He just looks like a bad guy. But he&rsquo;s also, like, extremely funny. So he&rsquo;ll just like.
Speaker
But. It&rsquo;s true.
Taylor
Well, it&rsquo;s this.
Craig
Costume at the moment is it is it? Kind of mediaeval Scottish cute.
Marcus
Probably. Basically looks like the bad boy love interest in a mediaeval isekai young adult. Novel, yes, true.
Taylor
Sorry.
Marcus
Yeah. And he&rsquo;s just hilarious because he&rsquo;ll be the savage in the ring, and then he&rsquo;ll just say ridiculous things. In his problem is there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s the moment where senior and Cody bury the hatchet and make friends on smack down. He just comes out and goes. No, you hang up. No, you hang up and it&rsquo;s just. Come on, man. He just he&rsquo;s just got got a very dry wit. And also 70. Stephanie Baker versus Naomi for the women&rsquo;s world. Championship, which is the Royal Women&rsquo;s Belt. So those are the three four matches that we&rsquo;ve got so far. Yeah. Cody Rhodes versus Drew McIntyre isn&rsquo;t confirmed, but it&rsquo;s probable.
Craig
Right. And that&rsquo;s in Paris in Paris? Patty. Right. So again, it would be fun to are there any Paris performers at the moment?
Marcus
Any French performers?
Speaker
Yeah.
Craig
I&rsquo;m imagining someone in a mine costume dresses, right?
Taylor
Yeah.
Marcus
Look, most of the performers are. There are a few Irish performers, a few Aussies, a lot of Japanese and South American performers. But I don&rsquo;t think there are any from France at the moment. They have been in the past, but not right. Now.
Craig
Alright. Our final thoughts on wrapping up how summer slam and upcoming matches are going to evolve.
Taylor
In 40 seconds or less.
Craig
20 seconds or less so.
Marcus
I enjoyed summer slam, but there even better pay per views. It wasn&rsquo;t as good as evolution which. Was.
Craig
Incredible. All right, we have a message for you that you can answer.
Taylor
Yeah, yeah, it just is really off topic. But can I put can you put me as a reference on their resume? That&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re asking. And sure they can be put as a reference.
Speaker
Yeah.
Craig
Fantastic, helping helping the world out here on media.
Taylor
I&rsquo;ll do that.
Craig
I&rsquo;ve been your host, Craig, joined by co-host Taylor.
Taylor
Yep, there&rsquo;s 5 seconds. Come on, man.

  Craig
Alright, alright. Just an echo goes from the machine. I don&rsquo;t know what that was. This is media mothership though on Edge Radio 99.3 FM and I&rsquo;m your host, Craig, joined by co-host Taylor. Hello. Special guest Marcus.
Marcus
Howdy. How are?
Craig
We going, we are all locked in now. And I feel I.
Marcus
Feel good, Chad, are we?
Craig
Locked in and we&rsquo;ve got all systems green on on streaming, so we are indeed streaming on YouTube and Twitch as well as on the Internet WW. Edgeradio.org dot AU do people still say WWW in front of URL these days? Is that dropped?
Taylor
I didn&rsquo;t say it. Yeah, I think.
Craig
I. It&rsquo;s dropped. Alright, well, edgeradio.org dot AU also has a streaming. On media mothership, we explore how media shapes the reality around us and as we deep dove into a few weeks back with understanding. The Donald Trump Zelinski fall out through the John Cena Hilton, we&rsquo;re updating that now with our exploration of the latest WrestleMania event. 2041 so all that and more coming up. On medium mothership.
Marcus
That was brilliant. I I think it was the little grin that sold for me.
Craig
I&rsquo;m getting better. I&rsquo;m getting better. So, WrestleMania 41, let&rsquo;s set it up with a little bit of an explanation. Right. So we&rsquo;re submitting 41 in my notes, notes that I&rsquo;ve put together via ChatGPT, I confess, which is why it&rsquo;s so great you&rsquo;re here, Marcus. Just to Fact Check all of this information. So it was. It was in. OK, well, I think this is. Already wrong is in. It was in. Las Vegas because it&rsquo;s saying here is in. Paradise, Nevada. No, it was in.
Marcus
Yes.
Craig
That&rsquo;s not a.
Taylor
Good start. Well, remember Chet, GPT is like 2 years out.
Craig
Ah. So this is actually copilot. Now he&rsquo;s copilot.
Taylor
You should have used grok.
Craig
OK, OK. So it says here next it was a two nights spectacle featuring WWE&rsquo;s biggest stars from Raw and Smackdown. Is that true? That&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s good.
Taylor
OK, that makes. Sense.
Craig
What&rsquo;s the difference between raw and smack down?
Marcus
The two the 2A shows of WWE Raw airs on Monday nights Smackdown airs on Friday nights, and they both have their own individual roster of wrestlers because they&rsquo;re the the roster is that loaded, they need 2-3 hour shows to get everyone on.
Speaker
France.
Marcus
There. And they also have different titles that are defended. On them at this point in time, RAW has got the World Heavyweight Championship, the. Women&rsquo;s World Championship and the Intercontinental Championship men&rsquo;s Yep, plus the women&rsquo;s tag team belts and one of the men&rsquo;s tag team belts. There are two men&rsquo;s tag team belts, but it&rsquo;s just like the world belts and the WWE belts. Like how what&rsquo;s the difference and on on smack down they have got the undisputed championship, which is seen as the premiership. On women.
Speaker
What is?
Marcus
The main title, which is more important than the world heavyweight, even though some of them are heavyweights, it&rsquo;s got the women. Championship not to be confused with the Women&rsquo;s World Championship. They&rsquo;re two different titles. They also have the US men&rsquo;s, the US women&rsquo;s and one of the men&rsquo;s Tag team championships.
Craig
One of just hearing that list of belts and championships it did come across a YouTube short conspiracy theory about what sceners possible plan might be, which is to basically it sounds a bit like when the DC or Marvel Universe kills off all their superheroes and reboots with a year. One kind of fresh slate. Someone was saying that that scene is basically going to destroy the belts, right? These belts are going to be retired or something, and they&rsquo;re going to reboot. Some some championship narrative, does that make sense? Does that have you heard rumours? Is that is that an exciting thing that I&rsquo;ve said on?
Marcus
A look, it&rsquo;s it that has absolutely happened in wrestling promotions before CW in the dying days back in 1999, literally did a a company wide reboot reboot where all ongoing feuds. Stopped and all titles were vacated. And they didn&rsquo;t make things any better for themselves. They still went out of business. About 18 months later.
Craig
Because is there a barrier for entry in wrestling in terms of understanding the the storyline like there is in comics?
Marcus
And entering wrestling is extremely difficult because it is an ongoing narrative that goes back decades. It&rsquo;s very hard to find a point to slot into probably the best time to start watching. Even then, you&rsquo;re still gonna, you know, be missing a lot of context. Because. Needs to be a very high turnover for wrestlers because they used to be on the road performing 300 days a year. Yeah, massive injury, massive burnout, a lot of problems with substance abuse. So generally speaking, the rest would only be at the top of the card for three or four years, and then they&rsquo;d be gone these days because you know, they actually get time off and actually get to look after themselves. A lot of wrestlers. On the on the show right now, I&rsquo;ve been on there for 10-15 years, so there&rsquo;s less turnover, which means the storylines are, you know, they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re longer and there are more implications. If there&rsquo;s any one time of the year, but also it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s odd because even though there&rsquo;s this convoluted back story to every rest and promotion, it&rsquo;s only people only watch for a couple of years. Jim Jim Cornett, who was a Booker for many years, has coined what he calls the seven year rule. Basically, every seven years, there will be enough of a turnover in wrestling fandom.
Speaker
Where&rsquo;s?
Marcus
And enough people will have stopped watching because they will have grown out of it that you can start telling the same story again. No one. Notice.
Craig
Where are we at that cycle? Do you?
Marcus
Think it&rsquo;s a very ongoing thing. I think with with the other thing is that he coined that prior to the Internet, so it used to be a show it there once, like a weekly show it there once like very rarely get repeated unless you know there was a marathon or something along those lines or a highlight reel.
Craig
Yeah.
Speaker
Right.
Marcus
And if you wanted to watch a paper, you had to hunt.
Craig
Down the videotape of it. But now, with the Internet, as we&rsquo;ll be dipping into tonight, that information is quite easy to hand. You can see replays. It is because it is. I mean, one of the things that is different at the moment is, is the distribution through Netflix has broadened its engagement. So now can you watch raw if you have Netflix accounts at the moment, right?
Marcus
If you have, if you have Netflix, you can watch raw and smack down. I&rsquo;m pretty sure you can watch NXT, which is the developmental B show.
Craig
Live like pretty close. To where it&rsquo;s being added in the US.
Marcus
Yeah, they they broadcast it live here.
Craig
As well. Wow. Right. Yep. So you can. We are at a I think when I was chatting with you about WrestleMania, it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a Golden Age. Would you say in terms of? It&rsquo;s engagement at the moment, it&rsquo;s popularity. It&rsquo;s profile.
Marcus
It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s definitely in its third major boom period of sort of the last 40 years because there was the initial rise of hulkamania and then, you know, after after the steroid trial in the early 90s, wrestling in general took a massive downturn from the early. The mid 90s started coming back up with WCW, which was then WWE&rsquo;s rival with the New World Order Angle in 1996 and WWF responded with the Attitude era, which sort of late 97 early 2001 where the rock and stone cold were at the top of the ladder and then the business took a massive nosedive after WCW went out of business and the. The there was some questionable booking decisions following the end of the attitude era and now this is the third major boom period 24 years later.
Craig
So yeah, clearly Netflix has also seen this as. As a a good thing to bankroll and WrestleMania. So this was WrestleMania 41 which was which is the first WrestleMania to air on Netflix. We&rsquo;re just here that it&rsquo;s the highest grossing and most viewed WrestleMania in WWE history. Have you come across any data? Suggesting that it&rsquo;s the sense that this WrestleMania. Was shattering. Records of attendance or merchandise.
Marcus
It it didn&rsquo;t shatter records of attendance, it would have shattered records of the gate that they made because they keep jacking up the price on. The. Tickets, so it absolutely will. I I absolutely believe that it&rsquo;s the highest grossing mania just because of how overpriced the. Tickets have become.
Speaker 5
Uh.
Marcus
I mean, really wanted to 1997 WrestleMania 13, which has one of the greatest matches ever, and you know they was they were giving tickets away because no one wanted to see it and also had the lowest buy rate ever. But the the thing about me 41 is that yeah, I I believe that, but also it it demonstrably doesn&rsquo;t have. It doesn&rsquo;t have the highest attendance because there are.
Speaker
Hello.
Marcus
The the arena they&rsquo;ve they&rsquo;ve wrestled in bigger in stadiums. Rather they&rsquo;ve wrestled in bigger stadiums. They&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;ve they&rsquo;ve been I think 3.
Craig
Right.
Speaker
Yeah.
Marcus
Wrestlemanias that have had over 100,000 people in the building at.
Craig
The same time I do like imagining what the views like from those Nosebleed seats right at the.
Marcus
Back there are YouTube or Facebook shorts where you see people actually they pull out their phones and they zoom in to the TV screen above the ring. By it&rsquo;s utterly woeful. At that point. You&rsquo;re not there to see a match. You are there to experience. The crowd.
Craig
The atmosphere. Yeah, we should. Still be good. All right, so major storylines that went down. So it says here the event featured John Cena&rsquo;s final WrestleMania match where he defeated Cody Rhodes to win the undisputed WWE Championship, marking his record 17th world title is.
Marcus
That yes, that was one of the major stories going in. Just to just to answer a question from Paul, when you asked the best time to start watching the best time.
Craig
That happened. Yeah, yeah.
Marcus
To watch wrestling, it&rsquo;s probably to start. It is the beginning of January.
Craig
Ohh really. So there&rsquo;s an entry point there. At the start of.
Marcus
The year? Yep. Because at the start of January, they&rsquo;re building to the first major premium live event of the year, the Royal Rumble, which happens in late January, early February. And whoever wins the Royal Rumble gets a title shot at one of the major belts at Wrestle Mania, so that way that that crowns the number one contender for the biggest show of the year. So the story that they&rsquo;ve told going in with Sina is that he announced last year it was going to be his last ever year. He&rsquo;s doing his retirement run. It was going to be his last Royal Rumble. It was going to be his last. Domination chamber, so Royal Rumble determines who challenges for one belt elimination chamber happens after it determines who&rsquo;s going to challenge for the other belt. I remember thinking. All right, cool. Well, he&rsquo;s not winning the rumble then because he&rsquo;s not going to. Be the elimination chamber. If he wins the rumble. So. Came second at the Rumble and then won the Elimination chamber under dodgy circumstances, and there was that famous heel tone where they&rsquo;d been teasing that Cody was gonna turn evil, but actually it was Sina who aligned himself with the rock.
Craig
Really. So there was some teasing there, Cody.
Marcus
Oh yeah. He&rsquo;ll turn. So Cody Rhodes was previously the undisputed champion and the and the top baby face of the company. Like the main guy of the company. And there was this bit with rock, the rock trying, who&rsquo;s sort of the main villain. Like he&rsquo;s like Doctor Claw from Inspector Gadget trying to corrupt. Cody and take his soul and in the end, Cody told him to go and F himself and. But then it turned out the action. People thought that there was going to be a twist with Cody turning heel, but the. Actual twist was.
Craig
That scene I turned heel. So cultural impact with appearances from celebrities like Travis Scott and.
Speaker
Alright.
Craig
And the return of Becky Lynch, WrestleMania 41 reinforced WWE&rsquo;s influence in Mentor Entertainment. Travis Scott, Peggy Lynch. What&rsquo;s? What&rsquo;s that?
Marcus
We&rsquo;ll start with Becky Lynch first, because that&rsquo;s much easier. Becky Lynch is she&rsquo;s been one of WWE&rsquo;s top wrestlers for about 7 or 8 years, not just one of the women wrestlers. One of the top wrestlers, full stop. She just took eleven months off after her last contract ran out to spend time. With her daughter. And there was absolutely no announcement that she was going to be back. She joined in. With layer of Alqueria whose tag team partner had been injured. And so when Becky comes back at the at the at the at WrestleMania with absolutely no warning when her theme music hits, everyone went nuts.
Craig
Right, right. And again, it&rsquo;s that theme music and the audience picks up and and the sense of. You know, cultural impact that this.
Speaker
Yeah.
Craig
Figure.
Marcus
So that was Becky Lynch. Being there was a big one for wrestling fans. Travis Scott being there is this very bizarre thing that Triple H has been doing where so for anyone who&rsquo;s unaware, Triple H is the Booker that had the head head of content where he went to a random Travis Scott concert last year and gave Travis Scott the ******** belt which he revived. And they&rsquo;ve done this.
Craig
A music concert.
Marcus
Yeah, went to an actual cause. Travis Scott&rsquo;s, you know, Grammy Award winner, sells out really big venues and yeah, Triple H went and gave him the ******** belt at a concert, and they&rsquo;ve done this what they&rsquo;ve done with it is really strange because they&rsquo;ve essentially turned Travis Scott into. I guess the Silver Surfer surfer to the rocks, Galactus or like he&rsquo;s the like the mouth of Sauron where he he just randomly appears but he doesn&rsquo;t actually say anything. He really do anything he used appears and will occasionally like try to hit someone in the ring and that&rsquo;s all he does. Like he&rsquo;s contributed nothing other than a couple of cheap shots to Cody. Rhodes.
Craig
Right.
Marcus
And yeah, it was just. So. This is one of those moments where everyone knows that wrestling is predetermined. It&rsquo;s scripted. It&rsquo;s not a real conflict, and people get frustrated with Ohh man Travis Scott at WrestleMania 41 really stunk up the joint and people say, you know, it&rsquo;s not a real fight. You know that it&rsquo;s not real. Yeah, but it&rsquo;s still bad storytelling because.
Speaker 5
Was.
Marcus
The match that Cena had with Cody was not very good because.
Craig
At WrestleMania, it was.
Marcus
Atrocious. And the reason it&rsquo;s atrocious is because the storyline they&rsquo;re going for is that people have been asking for Cena to turn heel and become a bad guy for 22 years because they got sick of him a very long time ago and there. But he&rsquo;s been part time for the last 10 years. And it&rsquo;s weird because he was a babyface for so long. Everyone booed him when he was a full timer because they hated him and they were sick of him. And then when he became a part timer, all of a sudden they loved him. They couldn&rsquo;t get enough of him and they wanted him to come back. And so the problem is that his his heel turn and it&rsquo;s like he could have just coasted by and just played the hits and give people what they want. Over the last year. But he&rsquo;s actually, you know, trying something new with the heel turn. But it&rsquo;s just not really working because he&rsquo;s acting indignant towards the audience for the the negative reactions that they gave him.
Craig
All right.
Marcus
10 years ago. Whereas the last 10 years they&rsquo;ve loved him and it&rsquo;s just there&rsquo;s a really big disconnect between his reason for turning heel. But the way the fans are actually treating him in.
Craig
Right. Real life. Yeah. So I guess the script that he&rsquo;s. Working with and on is that he? Yeah. Has given so much to the fans. The fans are keep taking from him. It&rsquo;s too much and that kind of. Antagonism towards the fans that that, yeah, maybe it has an old. History to it, but.
Marcus
It&rsquo;s just and the the, the core tenet of a heel. The the main principle of a heel is that you don&rsquo;t cheer the heels you Boo for them. And so a lot of wrestlers, when they turn heel, will deliberately stop doing the flashy moves that everyone loves because they don&rsquo;t want people to cheer for them. So Seina has completely stripped back his style, and this is the first match he&rsquo;s wrestled. The heel. He hasn&rsquo;t wrestled once in the lead up between the the elimination Chamber and Mania seven weeks. Cody didn&rsquo;t defend the belt once since the rumble, so it&rsquo;s over two months. So going in this very strange lack of heat, I suppose, and seeing as just deliberately, he kept on stepping outside of the ring so that he couldn&rsquo;t get pinned. He, like the match, couldn&rsquo;t legally end, and it was an obvious he&rsquo;ll take to get the audience to vote for him. But the audience kept on cheering. Actually, it&rsquo;s a bit of an odd one because. Like people comparing it to rock versus Hogan at Mania 18. Oh yes, where the rock was the the baby face. And Hogan was the irritable villain. But they they cheered for Hogan and they booed for the rock. But this, they just sort of the audience sort of booed for everyone they booed, seen it when they were supposed to. They booed code.
Craig
Yeah.
Marcus
He because I guess they&rsquo;ve gotten sick of him. But it&rsquo;s also because, like, and it goes back to one of the strangest things about WWE, the last sort of 1520 years is the disconnect between the people who are in the stadiums and arenas watching these major events and the people watching at home. Because the people who are watching it in the stadiums and and the arenas. They are the people with the disposable income who are super nostalgic for what they watched when they were kids. So that was one of the reasons why. When Rock went up against seeing it about 10 or 12 years ago, they were they. Everyone was booing, seeing out of the building cause they hated him, hated him. But they grown up watching the rock during the attitude era, so they were cheering to see him back, whereas the kids at home will be cheering. Seen it because he&rsquo;s their favourite wrestler and now we&rsquo;ve got the people who are in the stadium to see senior versus Cody.
Craig
Hmm.
Marcus
Grew up watching senior at home. They were the kids cheering for senior at home. While the stadiums are booing him. And so now they&rsquo;re cheering. For him, and it&rsquo;s just very strange, and it was just not an entertaining match and it just ends with Travis Scott coming out. He&rsquo;s, yeah, seen hits. And everyone&rsquo;s like, oh, he&rsquo;s here. The rock&rsquo;s gonna be here. And the rock&rsquo;s not there. It&rsquo;s just Travis Scott awkwardly walks to the ring holding the ******** title and takes him a solid 4 minutes to walk to the ring. Like the entrances in WWE have been ridiculously long. Last couple of years, but 4 minutes it takes.
Craig
Was he walking slowly? High fiving.
Marcus
He was walking slowly. He&rsquo;s working heel. So he wasn&rsquo;t high fiving. He was just awkwardly staring at Cody and seeing it the entire. Way to the ring. It was terrible. It was awful, and then when he gets the, Cody distracts him and it&rsquo;s just he tries to distract Cody and Cody hits him, he gets revenge for the beat down that Cody got from him and seen her and rocket elimination chamber. It&rsquo;s just strange. Why is this happening and? More to the point, the thing that always breaks my suspension of disbelief because nothing requires more suspension of disbelief. The professional wrestling, if you can get into it, it&rsquo;s great, but if you stop to think about it, it makes no sense. And so why is it that Travis Scott is coming out here to help Selena? But none of Cody&rsquo;s allies are coming out to save him? Why, they just letting this happen?
Speaker
Hmm.
Craig
Yeah, interesting. I mean, as videos watching at moments where wrestling has broken the 4th wall and they try and. Talk about that. Manufactured moment, but just before we get past WrestleMania so it says historic matches. Seth Rollins won a dramatic triple threat match against CM Punk and Roman Reigns, with Paul Heyman&rsquo;s shocking betrayal adding to the drummer. So that was what it&rsquo;s defined as a historic match. How was that as a counterpoint to the? You know, seen a match? The the triple threat.
Speaker
Ohh.
Marcus
Match just just to get some context. So WrestleMania for the 1st 35 years was a one night event and then after a 7 hour mania they went. This is ridiculous and they started making it a two night.
Craig
Event and so when was it a one night? It was a.
Marcus
One night, up until a few years, for 36 years, WrestleMania.
Speaker
Feel.
Marcus
911 night event or one day event cause like the last few went for.
Craig
7 hours. That&rsquo;s a long.
Marcus
Event the like for Mania 35 the main event. I think the main event started at midnight. And the main event is usually one of, if not the longest matches on the card and then after it finished you know 80,100 thousand people then have to get in their cars and go home. So the traffic is ungodly.
Craig
Alright, really. Alright, so then over 2 nights. So the triple threat match was the first night.
Marcus
Yes, sorry. So the point that I that, that, that that I was getting to with that is that there&rsquo;s a lot of discussion over whether or not cause the main event is the last event of a show. But there&rsquo;s some discussion as to whether or not night 1 of WrestleMania Constitu. Roots our main event, or if it is the midpoint of the whole weekend.
Craig
Right. And I guess by that also the bragging rights, yes. To to be that in that event.
Marcus
And the storyline going in, which is very much a real life storyline, is that so there were three guys CM Punk rename Phil Brooks, Seth Rollins, real name Colby Lopez and Roman Reigns, real name Joanna I. So in cafe these three wrestlers all hated each other and they&rsquo;ve been they&rsquo;ve been building this story for about 18 months in real life. The real story going on was that Phil Brooks, who plays CM Punk. Had been at the top of the card in the early 20 tens, but and he&rsquo;s a long time wrestling fan but had never gotten to main event WrestleMania, even when he was the champion. They would put Cena versus rock on at the end of the night rather than him and he was supposed to main event night one last year. The planner seemed to win the elimination chamber and challenge for the World Heavyweight belt.
Craig
Really.
Marcus
But he got his tie, his tricep torn in the Royal Rumble. And so he. Had to sit out the.
Craig
Tricep tour was was an accident, one of.
Marcus
Those unfortunate it was an accident. He was very injury prone for a couple of years. He seems to be better now. I think he&rsquo;s learned how to work safer. But it the the benefit is that it ended up leading into the best feud of the year where they went. So this guy, Drew McIntyre, has accidentally injured him. Right. OK, cool. Let&rsquo;s write that into the story. And these two can have a really great food out of it. Yeah. But base of the story was Punk wanted his main event and they gave him the main event night one against Rollins and Rains.
Craig
Yeah, right.
Marcus
And people are saying, well, is it a real main event? If it&rsquo;s not the final match of the weekend? But basically the three of them put on an incredible triple threat match SO1V1V1 notice qualification. Whoever gets the first pinfall is the winner and the storyline going in is that Paul Heyman, who in real life is a wrestling Booker, a wrestling promoter, has been for 40 years, generally a manager of heels or heels, stables. Had been working with Roman Reigns throughout four or five years because reigns for the longest time couldn&rsquo;t cut a promo to save his life. Paul Heyman and Sam Punk in real life, very good friends going back to ECW and Ring of Honour. And so the the storyline going in was that Hayman had to leave, had to leave Roman Reigns and be in CM Punk&rsquo;s corner. And then at the climax of the match, he&rsquo;d betrayed them both and allies himself with Seth Rollins and the. Even though in isolation it was a great match and there&rsquo;s a really beautiful moment where it&rsquo;s only been done on fan cams, well, you know, phones after the match ended. But off to the end of the match, everyone everyone else leaves and it&rsquo;s just Sam punk in the ring by himself and he&rsquo;s just overcome with emotion. He kisses the the ring and he&rsquo;s in tears and they start playing his music as. He. Leaves. Yeah. So they were like, yeah, this is your main event. You&rsquo;ve earned this. Congratulations. We we really appreciate you. And now they&rsquo;ve just on on raw 2 nights later on the Monday night, they&rsquo;ve gone straight into. Alright cool so. Rolands and Paul Heyman have now started a heel faction, and that&rsquo;s going to be our so Rowlands has been a baby face for a few years now. Everyone loves him. They sing his theme song and everything, and they&rsquo;re like, this is gonna be our new storyline moving forward. This is this heel faction with Rolands and with Hayman and CM, Punk is going to be 1 of. The main opponents and the.
Craig
I mean, it was such a delightful. You know, almost like silent movie performance that was done during that night of betrayal, as the Paul Heyman character, like he&rsquo;s dressed. In a suit. Right. And he comes out and you know, he&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s like watching a silent film in terms of his emoting so strongly with his face. And his mannerisms? Yeah. Ohh. I&rsquo;m in a real dilemma. What am I going to do? And and I&rsquo;ve seen a couple of fan videos of of this this performance because it&rsquo;s one thing I guess seeing it with the choreography. It&rsquo;s another thing when you get the immediacy of it. It&rsquo;s.
Speaker
Hmm.
Craig
You know, it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s so delightfully hand fisted and and clearly his, I guess chewing the scenery with that. And then he goes up like the nature of his betrayal was, what was it like was nut shots for breaking up.
Marcus
Not shots if you if.
Craig
You. Hitting them.
Marcus
In the nuts, if you want someone to turn, he&rsquo;ll get them to punch another man. In the zones. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Craig
Yeah, because there&rsquo;s been a lot of. I mean, that&rsquo;s what the the, the scene that he&rsquo;ll turn with Cody Rhodes was kicking him in the nuts. The Bohemian betrayal of CM Punk, and who was it? Was it rains, the.
Marcus
Other way? Yeah. Betrayed rains and punk insider.
Craig
Was. Yeah, cooling behind them. And then and then nodding them from behind them.
Marcus
Rawlins.
Craig
Through their legs. It was.
Marcus
And it&rsquo;s been a thing. For one of the most. Infamous heel turns in all of wrestling. Not no, not all of wrestling in the modern era. Rather, is or one of the most infamous in terms of the most badly hand. Old Ones 2018, I believe they had Shinsky Nakamura, who&rsquo;s known as the King of strong style. One of the biggest new. Japan wrestlers. Ever. Came to WWE after an extremely storied and successful career in Japan, won the Royal Rumble, got a title and everyone went nuts. I was singing his theme song that was so happy for him. He got into a World Heavyweight Championship match against AJ Styles, who he previously had really great matches with in Japan. The match they had was very mediocre, Shinske lost and then turned heel by punching AJ Styles in the nuts and literally that was that was the nature of their feud. From then on it was that Shinsky had an obsession with trying to get AJ styles and the cajones. It&rsquo;s just is this.
Craig
And when was. Your ohh right right?
Marcus
2018-2019 Vince McMahon basically just going oh, he&rsquo;s Japanese and he can&rsquo;t speak great English. He&rsquo;ll never make it on the mic so. I can&rsquo;t. Have him as a top guy and. He&rsquo;s just never shinsky Nakamura never recovered from. That it&rsquo;s just.
Craig
That, that he&rsquo;ll turn and yeah, and.
Marcus
It&rsquo;s sad, but on the other, on the other hand, you get paid 6 figures a year to hang out.
Craig
In Florida and serve something feel too bad for him. So wrestle Mania 41 was more than just wrestling events. It was a global spectacle blending sports, entertainment and storytelling at an unprecedented scale.
Speaker 1
OK.
Craig
I&rsquo;ve got some YouTube shorts. We&rsquo;ll play them. I&rsquo;ve I&rsquo;ve just grabbed some media that&rsquo;s been circulating recently, so this this is from 2 weeks ago. The title is the rock ruined WWE WrestleMania 41. So here this is a fan theory. It goes for 17 seconds.
Marcus
Go for.
Craig
So we&rsquo;ll we&rsquo;ll play it and we&rsquo;ll get your feedback. Sorry.
Speaker 5
Is back at elimination chamber and and gets the big moment and he shows up at bad blood and gets the big moment with the bloodline thing. You know, he shows up at these random events, these random moments, and he basically comes whenever he feels like it and then he&rsquo;s not actually committed to the schedule and he&rsquo;s not able to do this full time.
Speaker 6
Now.
Craig
All right, so so he&rsquo;s complaining about rock. What was what? What was the nature of rock crew in WWE WrestleMania 41 that? This fans complaining about.
Marcus
He ruined it because he had set up over several appearances that date back to bad blood of last year, which is, I think, around sort of September, October, he&rsquo;d been slowly building up this idea of like him and seeing it being this new dangerous alliance. He&rsquo;s the main villain. He tried to corrupt Cody Rhodes. He&rsquo;s got history. The whole bunch of people in the roster, everyone was expecting and and last year he was in the main event of Night 1 and he interfered in the main event of Night 2. Everyone&rsquo;s expecting because he&rsquo;s the main villain of WWE. Essentially, that would be this, some kind of involvement to progress the story. And he just wasn&rsquo;t there. He he&rsquo;s just this non entity as far as the story is concerned. Even though he he was and one of the reasons why seeing as he&rsquo;ll turn initially was so well received, he says oh, there&rsquo;s the intrigue of he&rsquo;s working with rock. What&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s gonna happen in the story and then it just degrades into the scene is saying I hate I&rsquo;m here now because the audience is.
Craig
Mean to me. And as you were saying, Trevor Scott appeared rather than the. Rock. Yeah, at the end.
Marcus
And what&rsquo;s he doing there? No one knows. He doesn&rsquo;t say anything. He just appears, tries to hurt, hit Cody and gets whacked in return.
Craig
And that&rsquo;s it. So do you think the rock ruins WWE WrestleMania 41?
Marcus
I think if he was going to insert himself into the build, he should have been at WrestleMania. If he wasn&rsquo;t gonna be at WrestleMania, he should not have been part of the build. It&rsquo;s basically you&rsquo;re giving us the first two acts of a story and not delivering the third.
Craig
Next clip is who should dethrone John Cena for the undisputed WWE Championship. This was from. 8 days ago.
Speaker 6
That John Cena is a 17 time world champion. It kick starts a whole new exciting phase of his final WWE run. We know that he isn&rsquo;t going to retire with the WWE title intact, but there&rsquo;s a good chance he holds on to it for at least half of the remaining 8 months he. That&rsquo;s so who should be the one to dethrone him? It depends on whether he&rsquo;s still a heel or not. By the end of the year. If he continues in this direction, the logical choice is to have Cody Rhodes regain the title as it gives them a full circle moment and something to chase again. If Cena turns baby face, then the best call might be to either have Gunther dethrone him in a dream match. Or Seth freaking Rollins to get one over on his old rival one last time.
Craig
All right, so a classic kind of speculation of, could Sina turn baby face?
Speaker
The one paper.
Craig
Could there be another match between Cody Rhodes? Well, how did you feel about that unpacking of? Who should dethrone John Cena for the undisputed?
Marcus
In theory, it makes sense for senior and Cody to have a rematch, and for Cody to get his win back and get the belt back and be the top guy again. But I feel that&rsquo;s really risky because. The audience were all there for Cena and they weren&rsquo;t there for Cody.
Craig
So right, they&rsquo;re just saying they were booing Cody right where they should be cheering him.
Marcus
Yeah, he&rsquo;s a good.
Speaker
Guy.
Marcus
When a year previously, they&rsquo;ve all been clamouring for him to finish his story, there&rsquo;s that whole story about how. Dwayne Johnson, the rock in Real Life, had tried to oust Cody from the main event of WrestleMania 40 because he wanted it for himself and everyone took to Twitter to get hashtag. We want Cody trending, and there was this huge real life story about getting Cody back in the main event to follow the creator of the Triple H Him planning and everyone was behind him then, and then they turned on him at Wrestle Mania and the smack down before Wrestle Mania. So I&rsquo;m thinking I don&rsquo;t think putting Cody and Cena in a rematch is. Fairly safe if anything. They also said Gunther. Right. Gunther. Yeah. Gunther would be interesting because to have Gunther challenging for the undisputed belt would be a lot of fun. He&rsquo;s based this really old school. He&rsquo;s very old school in terms of his move set. So power bombs, knife edge chops, sleeper holds. That&rsquo;s pretty much it. Very basic, very 19. I mean, he&rsquo;s also he&rsquo;s totally not Hitler.
Craig
Because it&rsquo;s very German, right? He&rsquo;s very German. Right? Austrian. So, Schwarzenegger.
Marcus
Australian. He&rsquo;s all switch back to there. During general Ohh the ring general yeah.
Craig
Is that his name? The the ring. The ring, general. Yeah. Like they&rsquo;re going a whole kind of wartime Prussian military.
Speaker
Freak.
Marcus
Comes on in a military great coat with opera playing.
Speaker
Sure.
Craig
It&rsquo;s that problematic. Does anyone say? Yeah, this is a bit problematic.
Marcus
Here&rsquo;s the what here is the thing.
Craig
It looks.
Marcus
Wrestling is frequently very problematic. It&rsquo;s always had a very, very sketchy relationship with race. I think this is just my interpretation. I could be wrong. The guy who plays Gunther, I don&rsquo;t know what his real name is. Sorry, but he is. He&rsquo;s charisma is, quite frankly, off the charts and he makes it work. I mean, the dude gets by with maybe four or five moves. And everyone loves him and thinks he&rsquo;s one of the best heels working today. So I think he pulls it off. I could be wrong, but I mean, they&rsquo;ve had other instances of racially insensitive gimmicks like Mohammed Hassan, whose gimmick was that he was a man of Arabic descent who felt that Middle Eastern people. Were being treated unfairly following 911. And he was a heel.
Craig
Ohh.
Marcus
Yeah, that lasted about six months and I&rsquo;m pretty sure he was played by an Italian American. Gosh, Ouch. There&rsquo;s a pretty sketchy history of race and and wrestling, but I think I think good that makes.
Speaker
Wow.
Craig
It work. Yeah, it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s tricky, isn&rsquo;t it, when the wrestlers also need to again do that 4th wall moment. And say hey. You know, I went there like I was watching something was like some good old boy, like wrestlers that were performing good old boys, anti immigration kind of narratives against a Mexican wrestler. That was the storytelling was around that kind of first Trump era, you know, trying to like clamp down on illegals. Kind of narrative and thinking that this, this wrestler is an illegal immigrant and taking our jobs kind of narrative and then there, yeah, there&rsquo;s a new saying. Well. This is a role. This is not my thoughts on that, though I did enjoy in the last wrestle like Pre WrestleMania we were talking about the match up. That didn&rsquo;t happen on the night, right, which was against the El Grande.
Marcus
Guy El Grande americano.
Craig
Which and. That&rsquo;s really political, right? This is a performance like you&rsquo;ve got the Gulf of America, Gulf of Mexico being renamed Gulf of America. So how have they wrapped that up as a narrative? Because you&rsquo;ve got some really exciting Mexican wrestlers in WWE. So what was that match meant to be on paper?
Marcus
It it ended up getting so it was meant to be El Grande Americano who?
Craig
Is sounds like a burger from.
Marcus
It really does. Or a burrito. Who is the rest of the Chad Gable wearing a luchador mask and pretending that he&rsquo;s?
Craig
Someone else, and no one knows that, right? It&rsquo;s like a secret identity. Like, who is he? I&rsquo;m a real Mexican.
Speaker 1
Aye.
Marcus
Wrestler the The, the, the the joke is that it&rsquo;s so obvious that it&rsquo;s Chad Gable, but people act as though it&rsquo;s not. He was meant to have a match against Rey Mysterio. Who is? Not even Mexican. He&rsquo;s of Mexican descent, but he&rsquo;s from San Diego. He&rsquo;s lived in California all of his life, but he&rsquo;s considered one of the very greatest. I don&rsquo;t think he he&rsquo;s even a necessarily practitioner of Lucha Libre. He&rsquo;s a luchador that he wears the mask. Yeah, but considered one of the absolute greatest sort of lightweight wrestlers. He was supposed to be.
Speaker 5
Right.
Craig
Ever, right.
Marcus
Those two, because he&rsquo;s been his Mysterio, has been on the roster for. He&rsquo;s been a wrestler for about 35 years. And still moves like an absolute demon, so it was meant to be those two against each other. But Mysterio ended himself and he got replaced with another luchador and it was a good match. But the story is still. Ongoing, I mean.
Craig
OK, watch it.
Marcus
There was there because the blow off didn&rsquo;t happen. I mean, Chad Gable still playing El Grande Americano. He&rsquo;s still feuding with the other luchadors on the roster.
Craig
Moving to the next little clip, Cena, after winning WWE title. Cody&rsquo;s reaction.
Speaker 7
Cody didn&rsquo;t said a word and walked out after losing his title, seen it in the press conference, said that he&rsquo;s just here so he won&rsquo;t get fined. He labelled all questions asked to him, including the Rock&rsquo;s involvement as clickbait questions, and said that it&rsquo;s lazy reporting, he said to tune in to raw tomorrow to see how he ruins wrestling. Becky Lynch tweeted that she&rsquo;s back and she brought her daughter rude to the press conference too. Fans are criticising the night 2 main event of Mania 41 because it was nowhere close to that of wrestle Mania 40. But Cena winning the title was the best decision, fans pointed out when last year the Rock said that he will be at Wrestle Mania 41, but the reality is different now. In the post Wrestle Mania, press conference, Triple H said that China will get a solo induction when the. And is right. Dominic was receiving a. You deserve it. Chant in the post show he may turn Babyface again after 2 1/2. Years. I think he gets another title.
Craig
All right. Well, that was very that human YouTube short there by the human voice, very AI based. So there&rsquo;s a lot to unpack there. So Cena did a post match press conference in character as a heel. Yes. Did that salvage some of the less than successful match that had that had happened or or was the the post match press conferencing is a fizzle itself.
Marcus
Or the scene heel turn is so strange because a lot of people are enjoying the character work that he&rsquo;s doing. There&rsquo;s just a disconnect. Between the initial. The altered and the his concurrent motivation and the timing of his motivation. The match I think was just bad by design because Cena in character is trying to make wrestling lame and he wants to retire and take the belt with him. He wants to take his ball and go home. It&rsquo;s an it&rsquo;s an unwritten rule that wrestlers should always lose their last match and they should never retire with the title. There are very few circumstances where that happens. People are loving. Your work, though, like he&rsquo;s so entertaining as a bad guy, it doesn&rsquo;t mean that the match wasn&rsquo;t. I didn&rsquo;t see any, though, Dominic Mysterio, who got the intercontinental belt, he&rsquo;s Rey Mysterio, son, and he&rsquo;s an example of where he was. Someone was hated. His baby face turned heel, hated as a heel. All the right reasons. And now he&rsquo;s turning baby faces. Everyone loves to hate him so much they they aren&rsquo;t. Ironically, love him.
Craig
Anything else from that? That, that little clip. What was it? It was.
Marcus
Ohh yeah, about how Cody didn&rsquo;t say anything.
Speaker 7
Cody didn&rsquo;t say.
Craig
Yeah. Cody said it. Yeah.
Speaker 7
Had a word and walked out after losing his title. Cena in.
Craig
The OK, so yeah. How do people unpack the post, Cody?
Marcus
Loss the out of the out of universe reason is that Cody Rhodes wants time off because his wife&rsquo;s having a.
Craig
Second kid. Ohh. OK, that&rsquo;s nice.
Marcus
So. The that&rsquo;s.
Craig
Yeah.
Marcus
So he dropped the belt and Cena also wanted to beat Ric Flair&rsquo;s record and have the most recognised title runs in WWE history, right, even though Ric Flair has something like 25 title runs, not all them acknowledged by WWE. I don&rsquo;t know why and I feel like I don&rsquo;t know. I feel like Cody. They have done some damage to his brand just the way that he&rsquo;s being portrayed the this year. Because one of his complaints against Roman Reigns last year and challenging for the belt was that Roman Reigns never defended it, he defends it once every two months, whereas Cody, while chasing that was also having feuds with the Judgement Day and Shins, gained like more on TV every single week. Right? And Cody&rsquo;s basically. But like in terms of the way. That he&rsquo;s being booked. Obviously you know Cody Runnels, who plays Cody Rhodes, doesn&rsquo;t write the story himself, but the way that he&rsquo;s being portrayed is not helping any potential fan backlash and.
Speaker 5
I don&rsquo;t know I.
Marcus
Don&rsquo;t know it&rsquo;s going when he comes back. Hopefully he comes back to heroes. Welcome but. It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s. It&rsquo;s an interesting the the the ultimate problem with wrestling is that heroes and villains, you know, baby faces and heels are not defined by what they do. They&rsquo;re defined by how the crowd responds.
Craig
To them. Yeah. Yeah. That the idea of heat, right? Generating audience excitement or.
Speaker
Yeah.
Craig
We&rsquo;re kind of back and forth.
Marcus
Yeah, if people cheer for you and you&rsquo;re a heel, well, turn babyface because they like you. Doesn&rsquo;t matter if you never do anything nice as long as you say that you&rsquo;re a baby face, they&rsquo;ll like. And if you&rsquo;re a face and you get booed, just turn heel and become evil and they&rsquo;ll be for the right reasons.
Craig
So the last point that this clip was making, what is it, Dominic? They&rsquo;re saying that.
Marcus
Daddy, Dom.
Speaker 7
Dominic was receiving a you deserve it. Chant in the post show he may turn Babyface again after 2 1/2 years.
Marcus
I think he gets another title.
Craig
What&rsquo;s it? What&rsquo;s it? You deserve it. First chat.
Speaker
Run.
Marcus
Ohh basically, if a wrestler who hasn&rsquo;t had a title for a while gets a title and it&rsquo;s well earned. Like if they&rsquo;ve been. One of the things that&rsquo;s really praised by wrestling fans is restless, who wrestle every week, who show up, and they put on good matches on a consistent basis. That&rsquo;s what people like. That&rsquo;s why Cody was so popular last year, cause that&rsquo;s what he was doing and Dominic Mysterio.
Craig
Who&rsquo;s a heel? And it looks like a complete.
Marcus
Who is this you?
Craig
And like weaselly little character, he&rsquo;s a great performance of kind of like.
Marcus
Yes. Yeah.
Craig
You know, I I&rsquo;d see this guy at. Coles or Woollies without shoes. Yeah, drinking the milk straight from the.
Marcus
Yeah. Carton absolutely, always chewing gum. He&rsquo;s like a core tenet of his character is his obsession with chicken tendies. I don&rsquo;t know why either.
Craig
It&rsquo;s like deep fried or something or crumbed chicken things.
Marcus
Crumbed chicken, usually frozen and put either in the deep fryer or in the oven. He hasn&rsquo;t. He literally. I saw one into you with him where he just like they were just two solid minutes just talking about chicken tendies. It&rsquo;s just an inherent part of his character. I don&rsquo;t know why. Yeah, but because he puts on good matches because he&rsquo;s so funny, everyone is able to see past the character he&rsquo;s playing to the fact that the performer is very talented and the performer is very entertaining. And The thing is that. Obviously, wrestling is scripted, but the belts ideally shouldn&rsquo;t go arbitrarily to whoever created thinks should have them. The belt should go to the people who are doing the best work, getting the best responses, and because once you&rsquo;ve got a belt, all our eyes are on you and you are going to be perceived as the person who&rsquo;s drawing.
Craig
Right.
Marcus
The money. So even though even though it&rsquo;s the belts are not competitive in athletic sense, they are competitive in, I suppose like a marketing and merchandising and a prestige sense. So they were chanting, you deserve it and because he&rsquo;s done such great work and he&rsquo;s barely wrestled on premium live event, I think he&rsquo;s been in a couple of tag matches and he was in a shark cage. For women&rsquo;s world title defence last year, but I don&rsquo;t remember him having a single singles match in the 18 months that I&rsquo;ve been watching. So for him to come out and have this like incredible. On on premium Live event, he&rsquo;s definitely had singles matches on RAW that always be very entertaining. So for him to come out and, you know, win this variant, attaining fatal Four way match the and the audience like this guy is a really performer. He&rsquo;s put on a good show. We are consider US sports entertained and that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m going. You deserve it. You deserve it.
Craig
I often hear that charm, as I mentioned in the studio here. Yeah. OK. So. Any other main points from Russell Mania, we&rsquo;ve. Missed.
Marcus
Ohh we we haven&rsquo;t mentioned Randy Orton&rsquo;s mystery opponent.
Craig
Yeah. What happened there that.
Marcus
OK, so they&rsquo;d spent 18 months building up a rivalry between not 18 months more like 6 months, building up a rivalry between Kevin Owens and Randy Orton 2. Of the very. Two of the most popular performers for very different reasons, Kevin Owens is seen as one of the most safe workers. One of the most talented workers, and like everyone loves to build him as a heel. But he puts on the best matches, had a he had a a, a ladder match with Cody earlier in the year that was ridiculously good and I like you look at it, you think how these guys not paralyse. Last and Randy Orton&rsquo;s on the roster for well over 20 years, one of the top baby faces, everyone loves him. They&rsquo;re they&rsquo;ve been building up because Randy, Randy needs some time off, so they wrote him out with inverted commas with Kevin Owens doing a pile package pile driver on him and quote unquote, breaking his neck at Crown Jewel last year. Translation. They just want. He just wanted some time off. But a couple of weeks before WrestleMania, Kevin Owens and this is actually really sad. Kevin Owens announced on Smackdown that he needed neck surgery and he was not going to be resting for the foreseeable future. But because you know it&rsquo;s wrestling, it&rsquo;s the art of deception. Yeah, people. Weren&rsquo;t sure if it was real or if it was part of the storyline, so he got a mixture of cheers and booze as he was leaving.
Craig
Ohh no.
Marcus
And then he went on. Chris Van Vleet&rsquo;s YouTube channel and said, Oh yeah, this is real. I actually have to have neck surgery. Ohh. But man, like, just for such a for such a respected worker for him to like get that response because people weren&rsquo;t sure if it was.
Speaker
Oh man. The thing is.
Marcus
Drill or not, so that threw out the planning for Wharton&rsquo;s match at Mania because that because that&rsquo;s a blow off. That was a very long time in the making, but what they did was there&rsquo;s a wrestler for total nonstop action, Joe Hendry, whose basic gimmick is what if Freddie Mercury, but you revision.
Craig
Really. Yeah. Wow. Yep.
Marcus
And essentially he got really popular. Last year he&rsquo;s wrestling for 10 or 15 years. He&rsquo;s got a he&rsquo;s got a masters in business and marketing, and he&rsquo;s also an ex professional musician. So he wrote his own theme song into the music video to it. And he has all these little bits he has where he will, like, turn around and smile at the camera. And it&rsquo;s just so ridiculously cheesy that you can. Not help but enjoy it. And so they go. Who&rsquo;s the? Who&rsquo;s the mystery opponent going to be? And Horton&rsquo;s in the middle of the ring. He&rsquo;s looking at the entranceway and you see the 2 doors open and it&rsquo;s all pitch black. And then you hear the first night lines, the things are going see his name and he appears and everyone absolutely lost it. And does turn and smile and the lights come up. And Joe Henry&rsquo;s there. Oh, my gosh, cause TNA. For many years, we&rsquo;ve seen as a very solid alternative to WWE. They never got anywhere close to their numbers. But basically, if you didn&rsquo;t like the product that WD was putting on, just TuneIn and watch TNA instead. So in the mid to late 2000s they were on this absolute roll and then some bad stuff happened and then they sort of recovered from it a little bit. Basically, Joe Hendry has been the shining point. He&rsquo;s the current. Main champion and he&rsquo;s been the main attraction over the last year. He was at the Royal Rumble earlier this year because WWE and TNA doing a lot of collaborations, right. And so everyone just lost it. Randy Orton is doing all these hilarious like not bad, like smiling. Nodding, and then you&rsquo;re hoping for a really good match. It&rsquo;s just a 3 minute squash match where Joe Hendry gets all of his bits in but and gets his crowd responses, but he&rsquo;s just there to get squashed by Randy Orton. Oh gosh. And but it climaxes with Orton trying Joe Hendricks poses for the audience into the camera. And it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a very good comedy bit, but as an actual and it&rsquo;s a very good mania moment because of that shock factor as an actual match though, like if they&rsquo;ve been given 10 minutes to. Work with it would have, but, but ultimately Triple H doesn&rsquo;t want to make the champion of another. Company look good. Right. Although people, I actually watched an interview with Henry not long after and the guy and the interview was like, do you feel like you were wasted at Mania and Joe Andrew said, look, I got to wrestle Randy Orton in his 20th WrestleMania at Wrestle Mania, so you know, no, I have no complaints. I can only go up from here. I&rsquo;ve I&rsquo;ve got a I&rsquo;ve got a trading card that a Topps trading card that&rsquo;s out. That&rsquo;s already sold out. That&rsquo;s gonna be worth a lot. Very. Soon, you know.
Craig
Trading cards, that&rsquo;s. So what do you think, Taylor? You hyped, is this hyping you into wrestling?
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
Where&rsquo;s your? What&rsquo;s your wrestling status at the?
Taylor
Moment I I haven&rsquo;t. I haven&rsquo;t watched the WrestleMania from last year or this year actually.
Craig
You you turn your bucket list of what was discussed is anything you&rsquo;re particularly excited to hear to see to.
Taylor
Yeah. OK.
Craig
Watch the nutjobs, the smashing, the testicles.
Marcus
All about the nut shots.
Taylor
I still actually do want to watch the ones from last year and this year it&rsquo;s just cause they&rsquo;re not free on YouTube. That I haven&rsquo;t watched, yes. What is the status?
Marcus
On and they do upload individual matches to YouTube and they they and. This thing where they uploaded the 50, quote unquote greatest Romanian matches. So a lot of them have been uploaded on YouTube before because there was blood in them, but they&rsquo;ve all been up like 50 of them have been uploaded. Some of them might be uploaded, they will never upload it. Chris Benoit match because he murdered his wife and child and then committed suicide.
Taylor
Yeah, yeah.
Speaker
Ohh. Oh.
Marcus
So even though he had an incredible career, no. 1. &lsquo;S No one&rsquo;s a big pardon me. Gonna wanna talk about him in WWE ever again. Yeah, most of the matches for and they even they uploaded individual rumbles as well, a whole bunch of royal rumbles are up there, whole bunch of elimination share matches are up there. So the only the only I guess they don&rsquo;t show you the height packages, but I think the hype packages their own videos anyway. So you can certainly watch most of a WrestleMania card on YouTube. If you&rsquo;re willing to tolerate the ads.
Craig
Yeah. Well, we&rsquo;re pretty much at time wrapping this up. What&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s around the corner? What&rsquo;s next on your excited wrestling calendar? Is there anything locally as well in in Australia that like?
Marcus
Oh, there are a bunch of smaller wrestling promotions in Australia, this Hazy Championship wrestling in Launceston. Does Adelaide Championship wrestling in I I don&rsquo;t know what, what, what city that&rsquo;s in, but there are a whole bunch of different wrestling promotions around Australia it&rsquo;s like.
Craig
Cause Australia does have some global representation in wrestling.
Marcus
Yes. I mean, we&rsquo;ve got. Grayson Waller and Maria Ripley, who I&rsquo;ve made just us. But yeah, no, they&rsquo;re I and they they often have a ring set up. I&rsquo;ve been to a bunch of pop culture conventions and anime conventions that have had wrestling matches on. They&rsquo;re always good fun to.
Craig
Right. Watch live. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So often if you go to a even. Just a popular culture convention that might have. You know Stormtroopers and anime cosplay often. You might also see a wrestling ring setup with people in the costumes wrestling.
Marcus
And there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s always a macho man cosplayer. There is always a macho man cosplayer.
Craig
That&rsquo;s and and and that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s that 80s macho man. Costume.
Marcus
With the with the, the the cowboy hat, his sunglasses with the plastic strips over them, the Teslas, the beard, the.
Craig
Performance right? Pink and yellow. How about hats?
Speaker 6
Ohh yeah, digger.
Craig
Just before we, I mean if if you could cosplay as any cosplayer, if you could cosplay as any rest. Well, from history do you have? Would you, would you think, geez, if I could, if I could pull that off, I would cosplay that wrestler in the.
Marcus
Heartbeat me personally, I would probably go as I&rsquo;d go as crow sting.
Craig
Is that like the comic?
Marcus
Book crew. Yeah, so.
Craig
Right. That kind of Gothic makeup.
Marcus
Yes, Sting started out in the 1980s as a surfer who wore bright colours and had face pain and a blonde flat top. And then in 1996, Scott Hall, who was a huge movie I&rsquo;ve. That, you know, reasons getting darker, you&rsquo;re going to be the main hero of this really dark. Storyline you should. You should become the crow. And so he literally had the crow make up for the last 25 years of 25 years of his.
Craig
Career. Wow. Yeah. Taylor, do you have any, you know, chunk out dog?
Taylor
No.
Craig
Actually, he&rsquo;s definitely not the because that&rsquo;s African American.
Marcus
Wrestler I can see Taylor doing Owen Hart.
Taylor
OK, OK. Yeah.
Craig
I reckon I could pull off. Someone. Yeah, maybe maybe the the. What&rsquo;s his name? The manager of CM Punk.
Marcus
Ohh, Paul Heyman, Paul Heyman. You do that or you could do a Gomez Adams looking. Do Paul Barrow. Who was the undertakers manager?
Craig
I can see Paul Heyman. Be deep cup. Yeah, I get fans. All right. Well, we&rsquo;re at. Time. Thanks for listening to me, Mother ship this week.
