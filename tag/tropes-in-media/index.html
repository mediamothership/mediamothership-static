Craig
Yes, hello and welcome here to Edge Radio 99.3 FM. This is media mothership broadcasting out of Edge Radio Studios in Nepal, Luna, Hobart TAS I.
Taylor
Like how you say it like Edge radio studios like, that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s called. It&rsquo;s not. It&rsquo;s just edge radio.
Craig
Edge. Well, the thing about saying it&rsquo;s Edge Radio Studios makes it appear as if it&rsquo;s part of a media. Workshop like like the studios we&rsquo;re in. Studio A.
Taylor
Yeah, I know. Yeah, exactly.
Craig
In Edge radio complex. And we&rsquo;re exploring on media mothership as always how media shapes our understanding of the world around us. How gets it to kind of explain places we&rsquo;ve never been to. So if you&rsquo;ve only ever watched Japanese cartoons, you have, you might have a really.
Phoebe
Like.
Craig
Skewed vision of what Japan might be like. Yeah. So tonight, today&rsquo;s episode, we&rsquo;re gonna be jumping into that idea of how media particularly portrays Asia.
Speaker 7
Yep.
Craig
Before we go there, though, as always, we&rsquo;re streaming on edgeradio.org dot AU as well as on YouTube and Twitch. You can find us just by searching media mothership as well as we&rsquo;re on the DAB.
Taylor
You always say that, and no one outside of radio knows what a.
Speaker 2
Right.
Craig
Dab is if you&rsquo;re on the dab, the digital audio broadcasting system.
Taylor
If you&rsquo;re on the Deb, you don&rsquo;t know what the.
Craig
Deb is message us on SMS, yeah, directly into the studio.
Taylor
048881170.
Craig
Seven and one of our programme team members will get your message and pass it on to us, yeah. I&rsquo;m your host doctor Craig.
Taylor
Oh, we&rsquo;re going.
Craig
For the doctor, now HD, joined by Lord yes, Taylor Liston Ma, Ma Ma. So it&rsquo;s like Doctor Who. I&rsquo;m doctor. Who? You&rsquo;re the master.
Taylor
Yeah. Oh, I&rsquo;m happy with. That yes.
Craig
You&rsquo;ve been interesting iteration of.
Speaker 7
That. Thank you.
Craig
Today&rsquo;s topic. We&rsquo;re also joined by our guest Phoebe. Hey, Phoebe.
Phoebe
Hi, Craig.
Craig
Excellent. So Phoebe&rsquo;s here as a kind of litmus paper test because as we. Said. It&rsquo;s paper test. Well, just to help us stay on topic, because we&rsquo;re talking about the representation of Asia. Yeah. So she&rsquo;s going to flag us when we ourselves are committing Orientalist troops. Yeah. In our.
Taylor
When we get problematic, which?
Craig
Is pretty much going to start now.
Taylor
Yeah. So starting now.
Craig
The direction I wanted to take the show in because both of us have found that we&rsquo;re enjoying Cyberpunk 2077. Yes, so it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a video game. It&rsquo;s been out for four or five years now. I&rsquo;ve only just picked it up. It&rsquo;s set in a future. Earth in the year 2077, it&rsquo;s part of a bigger, you know franchise in. Called Cyberpunk, right, it started off as a role playing game. Of course. Before then you had Gibson&rsquo;s book, Neuromancer and so forth. But this vision of 2077 is very much a western view of a failed state environment where big mega. Companies now rural and everyone&rsquo;s getting implants and becoming half.
Taylor
Cyborgs. Yeah, yeah. The thing that it reminds me a lot of big Hero 6, actually.
Craig
Like the animated series, right, the animated movie.
Taylor
Yeah, like where they&rsquo;ve got, they&rsquo;ve got the mixture between. I can&rsquo;t remember, it&rsquo;s called something new Tokyo or something. That, yeah, mixture of Western and eastern sort of things.
Speaker 8
Yeah.
Craig
Yeah, and and it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s really interested me, the view of Asia that&rsquo;s coming out of that game and we&rsquo;ll talk about that next week, yeah. But this week what I wanted to do.
Taylor
Yeah, yeah.
Craig
Was think about.
Speaker 7
What? It&rsquo;s boring, yeah.
Taylor
Something more boots.
Craig
What are the roots? What&rsquo;s the history of that? Sync and as you know on this show we do a lot of deep dives into classic Golden Age radio. You&rsquo;re about to say.
Taylor
Something though? Or that&rsquo;s I was just going to riff on the fact that it&rsquo;s not.
Craig
A golden age, but sure. So what we&rsquo;re going to do is I thought I&rsquo;d try to find a classic radio drama which is in conversation with Asia. All right, so I found what many people were God as one of the legendary radio dramas from the 30s and 40s, which. Is the shadow. So many people might not be familiar with. The shadow but. It really was an immensely popular. Show and then became a magazine and a comic book series movie played with Alec Baldwin in the early 90s. Something some people saw. Many people see the shadow as a precursor to Batman. He shares many similarities. He&rsquo;s a kind of stealth based hero. Vigilante justice he gets trained in the Orient to 1st develop his skills and he comes back with this kind of, you know, not necessarily for the shadow mixed martial arts vibe, but this kind of mystical.
Taylor
OK. Training like Johnny.
Craig
English oh, is that the character that&rsquo;s played by? I mean, I consider that&rsquo;s a deep cut, yeah.
Taylor
Rowan Atkinson. Yeah, yeah. Johnny English reborn. He goes to, looks like somewhere in Nepal and trains with the monks there. Yeah.
Craig
It&rsquo;s that troop. It&rsquo;s that truck we&rsquo;re looking.
Taylor
You remember that?
Craig
So it is that. True of the Westerner, particularly the West. Man going to Asia, getting trained up in some kind of skills.
Taylor
Like Doctor Strange.
Craig
Doctor Strange? Yeah. I mean, it&rsquo;s full of these conventions and the shadows considered one of the earliest example examples of that trope of the person going to Asia being trained up and coming back with this mysterious Asian power. So we&rsquo;re going to break that. Apart a bit. And and have a look at at what&rsquo;s it doing through a specific episode. Would called the temple bells of Naban, which is the 5th episode Naban. Before we do that, I&rsquo;ve collected a couple of audio pieces which kind of unpack. Why the shadow is interesting to to look at just for those that maybe have never had the pleasure of listening to the shadow series. It first aired in 1937 and it went all the way through to 1954, so it&rsquo;s an incredibly long running series. It had a number of lead actors that took the role of the shadow, probably the most well known 1 is awesome. Welles played that role really early on in his career before he did Citizen Kane, which many people regard as the. Perfect movie, the best movie. We ever meet anyway, before he got to that height, he appeared as the shadow, very much to entrench himself in the American popular imagination, because the shadow was just so huge as a figure. So it&rsquo;s a mystery crime, a little bit supernatural series, although the shadow character himself. Always explains his skills as being rational, even though they sound like an invisibility skill, because the main thing the shadow is.
Speaker 7
OK.
Craig
What to do is not only crime fights as a vigilante, but he has this power to cloud men&rsquo;s minds, which means they just don&rsquo;t see him right. And he has this big black trench coat and a red scarf and this huge Black Hat.
Taylor
So how? How does he rationally explain?
Craig
That well, this is we&rsquo;ll hear this, this episode we&rsquo;re about to hear, or here halfway through the episode is a origin story, and it&rsquo;s all through this Asian trading that he attained. What many people know of the shadow is the opening spiel.
Speaker 9
OK, OK.
Craig
That he does. Or the narrator does which says you know, who knows what evil works in the hearts of men? The shadow knows, and I call after and.
Taylor
It was wait. So so I&rsquo;ve I&rsquo;ve had like at the start of some sort of song. I think it was. There was a there&rsquo;s like a. Oh no, it was at the start of a movie where they say if there is evil in this world, it lurks within the hearts of man. Isn&rsquo;t that?
Craig
OK. Yeah. Could have come from. I mean again, this is considered. This was the the slogan which launched the Shadow. In fact, that slogan used to appear on the A kind of compilation compilation. Radio drama series that he did. It became so well known that then it spun off to his own show, the shadow. So it&rsquo;s very much considered the the kind of slogan that launched the shadow into the popular imagining of America. He has a loyal companion, Margaret Lane. Lane, right. So kind of sidekick female character. And yeah, the shadow basically takes on gangsters mad scientists. You know, all typical pulp villain.
Taylor
OK. Yeah and.
Craig
Antagonists. So he has powers of hypnosis, invisibility.
Taylor
Well, how does he? How does he explain? That away, then?
Craig
Well, he says it&rsquo;s just his skill of being able to throw his voice. So he has this ability through his voice. He does have a ring, right. And as part of his kind of.
Speaker 2
OK.
Craig
Costume. He has this ring, which is meant to have some some kind of power, but again the idea here is that, as this Orientalist 5 sets up, he&rsquo;s also a kind of, you know, rational Westerner engaging with a mysterious Asian right. So he got these skills. Mysterious Asia, but as a rational Westerner, he&rsquo;s able to perfect them through his rationalism. OK, yeah, so it&rsquo;s very much that kind of Orientalist hope. So we&rsquo;ll break down some of these type of Orientalist narratives in this famous, you know, crime, pulp hero, drama series. The shadow shadow. Well we go. Let&rsquo;s say let&rsquo;s have. So we. So we have a little musical include. Yeah. V you&rsquo;re on music duty today.
Taylor
That&rsquo;s fantastic. Well, that&rsquo;s so much better than what?
Craig
Thank you. You&rsquo;ve done in the best, most talented music we&rsquo;ve played on that it&rsquo;s amazing what that thing&rsquo;s capable of.
Speaker 7
Wow. Wow.
Craig
Gee, OK, so all right, so I want to show play a short excerpt from a radio drama documentary that covers the history of a famous radio drama Guy ***** Brown.
Taylor
Just go to bed.
Craig
In episode 4. They talk about the impact. Of the shadow. So oops, sorry. Hold on, let.
Speaker 7
Me just queue.
Taylor
It up. You can&rsquo;t do this on.
Speaker 11
Oh.
Craig
Air no build suspense. Just make the shadow.
Taylor
OK. Ohh God. OK, here we go.
Speaker 9
On a night like this, then?
Speaker 3
No Washington assignment for me, no ridiculous detecting for you.
Speaker 4
I love it.
Craig
It&rsquo;s a great harm.
Taylor
And organ. Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 12
And of course, the shadow the show my mother starred in, it was adapted from a series of Pope novels written by Walter Gibson in the storyline wealthy Playboy Lamont Cranston has travelled to the mysterious E old Time radio, was filled with cringe, making tropes like this. There he encounters a Mystic who teaches him.
Speaker 10
The hypnotic power to cloud men&rsquo;s minds, so they cannot seem.
Speaker 12
This is useful if you decide to set up as a crime. Fighter. The shadow reveals himself to lowlifes with a menacing laugh.
Speaker 8
Oh, no. What evil lurks in the hearts of men? The shadow knows.
Speaker 12
The show had a number of false starts with different actors, but established itself with the casting of Orson Welles as the main character. Cranston and his mind penetrating older ego. My mother&rsquo;s role have I made mention of this before? Was the lovely Margot Lane, the attractive confidante of the Playboy?
Speaker 9
The three men you tell me.
Speaker 8
About they look like gangsters, alright?
Speaker 13
Yes, ma&rsquo;am. Yeah. And usually in mortal enemies, but tonight it looks very much as if they&rsquo;re banding together.
Speaker 8
I wonder why of you then why you come here and expose yourself?
Speaker 13
And mad because they&rsquo;re afraid of memes. They&rsquo;re only afraid of me as the shadow I do not know. Lamont Cranston. Oh, who? Who are they?
Speaker 12
Mum knew Wells already. They both toured with the successful production of the Barretts of Wimpole St They were buddies, they were friends. She thought highly of him and also sort of giggled at him a lot because she thought he was very full of himself. But Mum wasn&rsquo;t the first Margot Lane, although the character was.
Craig
All right, so. As that sets up it&rsquo;s character based in Pulp Fiction, it became immensely popular. There was a documentary series done on the shadow. And we&rsquo;ll listen to some excerpts from here as the cast and key production talent of the shadow kind of breakdown. What the series did that made it so influential. Ohh, just cute. Oh, going too far. Hold.
Speaker 14
On that succeeded in the media of the imagination.
Craig
It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s tricky with this.
Speaker 14
He was.
Speaker 7
Small little mobile phone to *** ****. Alright, hang on.
Speaker 14
The shadow. Is from Maine to California. The shadow endures today as the dominant symbol of mystery drama during radios Golden Age in the 30s, forties and early 1950s.
Speaker 15
Two years ago, I was in the hospital for an operation. And the resident Doctor Young resident came running up to my. Room to meet me. Because he he knew that I had been associated with the shadow which everybody knows. I mean, they may not have heard anything else about. But radio, but everybody knows the shadow.
Speaker 9
It could never have succeeded in television. It it, it was the marvellous thing of what what people conjured up in their minds, and then they could see the shadow, and they could see Margot and so forth. I think it would have been a terribly dull television programme.
Speaker 14
What creative forces moulded the shadows? Tremendous popularity. Why, after nearly 60 years, is the programme not only remembered fondly but still being aired on many radio stations across the nation? Who were the people that shaped the character&rsquo;s success? We&rsquo;ll take an in-depth look.
Craig
So they&rsquo;ll breakdown then what the key aspects of the shadow are, but what I want to jump to, there&rsquo;s a really there&rsquo;s a couple of really interesting parts of the whole document goes about now and we&rsquo;ll put the link to it in the show notes. There&rsquo;s a couple of aspects to it, which is really fascinating. Here&rsquo;s 1 little clip. About the the struggle of doing radio because it sounds so corny. When you listen back to it, particularly today. So of course we mainly engage with storytelling through movies and TV. One of the trouble, one of the difficulties, one of the challenges of doing audio only storytelling is you have to sometimes over explain what&rsquo;s happening because the audience can&rsquo;t see it. So it&rsquo;s. Yeah, there&rsquo;s a snake coming straight for me, and it&rsquo;s being lifted from the the the crates, then the hands coming down now, too. So there&rsquo;s a nice little section here where they talk about how dated. Listening to episodes are from the shadow, we&rsquo;ll have a listen to the episode shortly. But it&rsquo;s interesting that even the voice actors. When they hear it back now kind of cringe or recognise how.
Speaker 14
The programme demonstrating the caring, the concern a true star, often feels for the success of his enterprise.
Speaker 11
Funny it is.
Speaker 16
The people looked the. Way you wanted them to look. The places look the way you imagine them and now with television, it&rsquo;s feta compli. I mean, you accept it, and if you don&rsquo;t like it, you turn it off and go to something. House. But that was the beauty of radio it it helped to stimulate the imagination and. In comparison, now they sound very corny. When you listen to some of these old shows. Because we&rsquo;ve made such tremendous strides. Technically, and also performance wise. In radio, everything had to be spelled out in large capital letters so that, you know, I&rsquo;ve got you covered with this gun, you know, so that it was clear to the audience what was happening. Which today makes it seem kind of corny, but that was the beauty of radio. And that&rsquo;s the thing that I think is is missing in our entertainment today.
Craig
It&rsquo;s interesting also that point when you&rsquo;re at a disruptive media technology moment. So here we have people trained and made their professional career in radio. Bemoaning what&rsquo;s been lost because of the popularity now of television. Yeah, right. So, of course, this was recorded in, like the 60s and 70s, and this documentary, and they&rsquo;re talking about what it was like creating audio, which they see was better because it had to be more imaginative. You had to do that theatre of the mind.
Speaker 16
Hmm.
Craig
Work and efforts to visualise what&rsquo;s happened.
Taylor
So with the advent of TikTok, what have we?
Craig
Lost. Well, exactly. Now we have similar ballooning of what we&rsquo;ve lost from, I&rsquo;d say AI right, people saying, you know, we&rsquo;re becoming Dumber because we&rsquo;re relying too much on AI. And when entertainment is generated through AI. It&rsquo;s a lesser quality product than when I worked in media before AI, where it was all human creativity. Similar thing happening now. I think in terms of disruptive technology of AI causing people, particularly those that establish their professional careers pre AI to say, you know we&rsquo;re losing.
Taylor
Out. That just reminds me of when I talked about what was it, study gate or whatever it was and that.
Craig
Ah yes.
Taylor
Had all of the. The professional what&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s the code where you&rsquo;ve got read by other people?
Craig
Peer review.
Taylor
Peer reviewed AI? Yeah.
Craig
Yeah, yeah. Episode 87. Listen back chat, GBD.
Taylor
Found in heaps of.
Craig
Them I look, I have fantasies of time travelling with ChatGPT going back in time and just being a sensation. Anyway, that&rsquo;s my own fan fiction. I&rsquo;ll be doing like.
Taylor
I just like to say to the person who&rsquo;s on Twitch.
Craig
Yeah.
Taylor
Saying and it it it, they&rsquo;ve given me a message. I&rsquo;ve received the message, but I&rsquo;m not going to read it out.
Craig
Right. We&rsquo;ve got some comments. Wow. All right, so thank you always for audience engagement. Please keep it coming.
Taylor
Yeah. Yeah. Thank you, Nathan. Or big Nate as he&rsquo;s.
Craig
Known Nate. Alright, thanks, big Nate. All right, so the next little segment I want to play is the the the cast of the shadow talking about. When the fan audience of the shadow started to blur reality and fiction. OK, so as we do in this show, we often look at moments where. Media blurs reality where people understand reality through media, and it&rsquo;s amusing that you know there, there there are moments where that confusion gets really even superhero characters where you think these this is just Pulp Fiction. Superheroes, really. No one thinks it&rsquo;s real. It&rsquo;s a fun little comment here where they where they. Say, oh, some people thought it was real, OK?
Speaker 14
He&rsquo;s with the shadow as host prior to his becoming the central character. Of the 700 programmes that featured Lamont Cranston, about 200 are known to have survived, and of these, around 100 are available commercially on disc. The 200 programmes in circulation, either commercially or traded among collectors, are fairly evenly divided between performer.
Craig
Sorry, that wasn&rsquo;t. The clip let me find it. Hold on.
Taylor
But.
Speaker 16
They&rsquo;re able. To.
Speaker 7
Then.
Speaker 16
Drop on their.
Speaker 14
Line recently, Grace Matthews recalled how she felt auditioning for the part of Margo Lane in 1946.
Taylor
Just hold.
Craig
On here. OK.
Speaker 16
But he also had the power of Orson Welles.
Speaker 14
For several years in the mid 40&rsquo;s, the shadow programme originated before a live theatre audience. Brett Morrison typically went the extra mile in scenes where Cranston became the shadow and solely for the benefit of the theatre audience. As the radio audience could not see him, Morrison would Don his own Cape and slouch. That to match the appearance of the shadow as he was depicted in the Shadow magazine. Mean. In preparing this programme, we talked with more than a dozen of Morrison&rsquo;s contemporaries on the shadow. Not one had anything but praise for this fine actor.
Speaker 16
This is quite amazing, but you&rsquo;d be surprised how many adults actually thought that Lamont Cranston was a true character who had the power to make himself invisible because toward the end of the programme, or somewhere around? I think when we were in Korea. Yeah. We would receive letters. I&rsquo;d receive letters to people saying. We think it&rsquo;s a crime, that you&rsquo;re keeping the shadow here when he could be spying for our country, you know, again. Ohh yes. Really.
Speaker 4
Really.
Speaker 16
I had no idea that that I&rsquo;ve I&rsquo;ve seen this happen. Identity happen in daytime radio, you know, with characters they they think they actually exist and it&rsquo;s I don&rsquo;t know how they they correlate the time element that that a certain time they&rsquo;re able to eavesdrop on their lives recently grace.
Speaker 9
Isn&rsquo;t. Amazing. Yes, yes, yes.
Craig
It&rsquo;s an interesting point that during the Korean War, when the shadow was broadcast. There were messages coming through letters from fans saying, you know, it&rsquo;s a crime that the shadow, the shadow person, isn&rsquo;t over in Korea helping to win the war by using his powers to spy on the enemy, forgetting this as a fictional character, right. I&rsquo;ve heard this in terms of. Like superhero movies during World War 2, certainly, DC, for instance, never engaged with stories of fighting the Nazis. Yes, there&rsquo;s no episodes where Superman or. Or Wonder Woman, the DC heroes for the Nazis, or the Japanese enemy because they didn&rsquo;t want to diminish the real struggle that real people were facing in the war. That if you&rsquo;ve got someone as super powered as Superman, yes, he would finish the war. But obviously we can&rsquo;t.
Phoebe
Hmm.
Craig
In a.
Phoebe
But.
Craig
Fictional story. Have the war ending when you know GI&rsquo;s are going out, dying every day to win this. So instead they just didn&rsquo;t have storytelling about the the fantasy power of Superman. Here. On the other hand, you have fans then saying, you know well, why don&rsquo;t you send Superman over there to to beat Hitler because. You know, you really need everything, forgetting it&rsquo;s a fictional character. Yeah, like the shadow. The last little segment I wanna play was. It&rsquo;s really fascinating. Like we think about toxic fandom as a modern problem, right? Like George RR Martin constantly getting hassled by fans to release his show. His final episode, final story. There&rsquo;s a great segment. Here where they talk about the toxic fandom that they&rsquo;ve experienced them. Mouths in their professional careers, on the shadow, and it&rsquo;s very similar to. In fact, it seems worse than the problems that we&rsquo;re facing today, particularly the types of toxic behaviour of fans towards the female cast members.
Speaker 9
Cart was going, he was away over most, most all weekends. He went up to Canada to. To. Do the Imperial oil hockey broadcast and he&rsquo;d leave on Friday night and come back Monday morning. And of course, the shadow was on Sunday, so you know, I was there alone, and I had these kids who would phone up and really at first it was kind of fun. They say, ohh. Michael, we&rsquo;ll meet you in the cemetery or something like this. But then finally it got a bit scary and then they would come around to our apartment and lift signs all over with. Kind of. Nasty words and stuff. It was just it got too much, you know. But mostly the the mail was marvellous. It was. It was a great response. I don&rsquo;t know. I mean, you certainly have daytime soap. You got a lot of male soap, but I think it was equally as as big.
Speaker 14
Miss Matthew was recalled.
Craig
So there we go. That toxicity, that faces many fans towards even stars from the Golden Age radio in the 30s. These. Alright, so short include with some music.
Speaker 7
Nice.
Craig
So we&rsquo;re back now, and let&rsquo;s jump into an episode. So we&rsquo;ve kind of set up what the shadow is all about. Crime fighter, immensely popular series. Some people confused from actually being a real person with great powers. I want to jump now into Season 1 Episode 5 with Orson Welles playing the main role. Of the shadow. And it&rsquo;s an episode called the Temple Bells of Naban, first aired October 25th, 1937. It has an entry in TV tropes right? The key tropes that are in this episode is anti magic. The temple bells of Naban, the title of the show. They&rsquo;re actually a charm. Possessed by the antagonist Saudi, and it allows her to defeat the mystical powers of the shadow. Right. That&rsquo;s the first St second rope is drugs are.
Speaker 12
That.
Craig
Right. Because the whole narrative hinges on a heroin drug ring, right? It&rsquo;s incredible to me to think there&rsquo;s a 1937 radio drama directly addressing heroin drug rings. So it&rsquo;s a heroin drug ring that gets a wealthy capitalist son. Addicted and that draws in the attention of the shadow to help save the sun. It&rsquo;s an origins episode. So in this episode we&rsquo;ll hear how Laman Lamont sorry, the main character explains to Margo. That he learned his powers by studying with an Indian priest, the keeper of the Temple of Cobras in Delhi. Wow. So I&rsquo;m sure that&rsquo;s the thing. If we&rsquo;ve typed into Google Maps, we&rsquo;d find that so obviously highly oriental is there, and Margo suggests that he come out into the open as a crime. Right. To which Lamont further explains that he, however, instead operates in the secret as the shadow, for fear that if he did go public, others would learn his secrets that he got from the temple of Cobras in Delhi and used them for evil. There&rsquo;s also the final trope is the snake. Karma trope, again highly oriented horse trope.
Speaker 7
M.
Craig
The main character, Saadi Ben Arda, is an exotic dancer and snake charmer, so yeah, very orientalist, who can use her skills to make a Cobra attack. Of course, in this episode what she doesn&rsquo;t bargain for is that shadow has, as we&rsquo;ll see in the final twist. Small spoiler here switched out her trained cobra with another one and she gets bitten and died. Died dies. Yeah, so it&rsquo;s a great episode basically. Again, it&rsquo;s a nefarious drug ring which is selling dope on the streets of new.
Taylor
Well, there we go.
Craig
They&rsquo;ve made this mistake, though, of ensnaring the son of a VIP and the VIPs demanding action be taken by the police commissioner to save his rich druggies, hunt a bit of origins, some great classics. Fighting. So what we&rsquo;ll do is we&rsquo;ll break it down in terms of some key motifs as well as just broadly before we jump in this idea of exoticism that&rsquo;s in this episode. So this is really peak. 30s Asia exoticism right you have this idea of the main antagonist to a rational Western shadow character. The main antagonist is Saudi Ben Arda, right, an exotic female dancer and snake charmer, right? So it&rsquo;s a heavy trope that aligns with this. Idea of the imaginary Orient. She&rsquo;s also not just. Is she a? Foreigner from India. She&rsquo;s also a mystical person. She&rsquo;s seductive and super dangerous. So again, if if anyone&rsquo;s an Edward Saeed fan who coined the term Orientalism, they&rsquo;ll know this is the classic thing. Saeed says embodies the western fantasy of the east as this irrational and sensual object. Said would argue that.
Taylor
Mm-hmm.
Craig
The character of Saudi Bernarda that we&rsquo;ll listen to in a second. Isn&rsquo;t reflecting a real person from Delhi? There&rsquo;s probably no real person from Delhi that&rsquo;s like this character, Saudi Bernarda. But it&rsquo;s all about Western desire and western fear that we&rsquo;re seeing. So we&rsquo;ll we&rsquo;ll get into some of the setup of the episode and I&rsquo;ll interrupt as certain. Classic Orientalist tropes kick off. OK, so here we go. Let me queue it up. Here we go.
Phoebe
Yeah.
Speaker 17
Safe, healthy and economical fuel, then by all means you can recognise her.
Craig
We&rsquo;ll skip the promo at the. Start here we go.
Speaker 3
They still shadow The Dells of never. They will reveal you.
Speaker 1
Your third mistake, Saudi and your last.
Speaker 3
No, it is your mistake and your last. This is the end of your career as the shadow.
Craig
So that, of course was a little bit of a prelude. The female voice there of Adi Bin Sada, who&rsquo;s the antagonist very much. The opposite of Lamont. The shadow. In terms of the save the cat setup, OK, we&rsquo;re going to start with the 1st 30 seconds, which is a classic kind of. You know, we had a kind of a bit of a classic eerie theme there that we&rsquo;re hearing.
Taylor
Oh yeah, talking about the case.
Craig
And we&rsquo;re going to get the theme set up now around the intro. So we&rsquo;ll listen to how they set up the characters of Lamont and Margo Lamain. Margo lane. Sorry, in this normal world. So it starts in the normal world as they&rsquo;re talking to go to a radio drama. Sorry, a. Theatre plane, yeah.
Speaker 2
Large evening a couple of hours at the club. Caleb does. That intrigue you?
Speaker 4
Lovely, but not too late. I have an appointment at 10. In the morning at the Women&rsquo;s club. They&rsquo;re trying to get them action on this terrible narcotics situation and it stops being peddled all over town. They found schoolchildren using it, society women. Why? It&rsquo;s already called the half dozen suicides.
Speaker 2
Yes, I read about that. I know it&rsquo;s terrible.
Speaker 4
Stuff need the shadow to get at the bottom of it.
Speaker 2
As I know, dear. But for tonight I I do enjoy just being myself. Lamont Cranston. Dilettante. That&rsquo;s be the shadow. Only in real emergency. You know the. In China, there&rsquo;s a lovely Indian dancer at this new club, Caleb.
Speaker 12
Indian dancer.
Speaker 2
You know, there&rsquo;s the place just there have killed driver, yes.
Speaker 4
Lamont, you are going to do something about. It you&rsquo;ll start.
Speaker 2
It already, perhaps. Yeah, we are right. Drive up. What? Thank you, Sir.
Speaker 4
Ohh, that looked like young. Jerry Clayton just going in, yes.
Speaker 2
I was that young man&rsquo;s father. I&rsquo;d spank him and keep him home occasionally.
Speaker 4
Spoiled son of a wealthy style.
Speaker 2
Yeah. Let me have your code. I&rsquo;ll check it with mine.
Speaker 4
Good evening, Jerry.
Speaker 10
Oh. Oh, hello, Miss lane.
Speaker 4
Good father and sister. Well, I haven&rsquo;t seen them lately.
Speaker 10
Yes, yes, I&rsquo;m sorry, but I can&rsquo;t wait right now. I&rsquo;ve got to see someone, and it&rsquo;s important. I&rsquo;m sorry.
Speaker 2
Hello.
Speaker 4
I don&rsquo;t know if you don&rsquo;t get upset about something. He doesn&rsquo;t look well, either pale and shaky.
Speaker 2
You&rsquo;re right, it doesn&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m curious about that boy.
Phoebe
Umm.
Speaker 2
Well, let&rsquo;s go in.
Speaker 17
And show you to the tables.
Speaker 4
There&rsquo;s someone getting up. To speak, we seem to just in time. For the main attraction.
Speaker 17
Ladies and gentlemen, we take pleasure in presenting the fascinating and beautiful dancer of the Far East, Sadie Bell. Her first number tonight, she will give you the dance of the Cobra. Zadie Bel? Ada.
Speaker 4
Look, she&rsquo;s lovely.
Speaker 2
Yes, real thing too real Hindu.
Phoebe
Hmm.
Speaker 2
That&rsquo;s odd you. Know.
Speaker 3
Look, she&rsquo;s taking.
Speaker 4
A snake out of that wicked bat.
Speaker 2
A live cobra.
Speaker 4
Oh, heaven.
Speaker 2
Another Cobra is connected with the old Indian mysticism, the most ancient of magic. See how she quiets. The snake makes its way to the motion of her hens. It&rsquo;s a form of mesmerism. They never improved on it with all our modern psychology.
Speaker 4
I hope it&rsquo;s there within remote.
Speaker 2
Well, they undoubtedly have. Ohh. This is the one they call Saadi bin Lada. Jerry Gleason, with that strange look in his eyes. An epidemic of narcotic smuggling. Saudi bin laden.
Speaker 3
What is who she is.
Speaker 4
She keeps looking over here. Lamont. Yeah.
Speaker 2
It&rsquo;s coming this way well.
Speaker 3
You will need for the beautiful lady star. Oh.
Speaker 4
Oh, a bracelet. Thank you.
Speaker 3
Ohh, you know the tongue of Mother India? Sad.
Speaker 2
Only enough to make a small prayer only enough for that.
Speaker 13
Sadly, bell ada.
Speaker 3
It is good sometime to know a small prayer.
Speaker 2
Hmm, just in case of an emergency.
Speaker 3
Yeah. You are very welcome in case you should meet someone who could destroy you. Bella.
Phoebe
Just.
Speaker 4
What did she mean by that?
Phoebe
I.
Speaker 2
Don&rsquo;t know exactly. Funny something. She seems to know something about me. And trying to recall where I&rsquo;ve seen that face.
Phoebe
Yes.
Craig
So the story. Keeps building up as there&rsquo;s more revelations of the drug crime that&rsquo;s going on and turns out that main protagonist there that was introduced. The female Mystic Saudi Bernarda, the snake charmer is in. Cahoots with the local? Port captain and they&rsquo;re importing all of this heroin into New York and getting wealthy claim until hooked on it and then scamming them for their money. What&rsquo;s really interesting there is, again, establishing that the protagonist, antagonist tension is built around that Orientalism, right? You have the protagonist, the shadow, the Western trained superhero who went to India to get his his skill set. Who&rsquo;s here confronted with someone that. That seems to know what he&rsquo;s about. Never met them sadly bin Laden, but seems to understand and, you know, is the opposite. The antagonist, you know, mystical, seductive, dangerous. You&rsquo;ve got this kind of rational West, right? So who&rsquo;s talking about the power of mysticism and the power of the snake charm? Even we in our in the West have not been able to control this hypnotism verse because it&rsquo;s this versus this irrational.
Taylor
Yeah. We&rsquo;ve got another comment on the Twitch.
Craig
Eastern other.
Phoebe
Great, yes.
Taylor
And it says and and I&rsquo;ll let you answer this one. What is the topic of discussion today? I&rsquo;ve got this on in the background whilst I play Flight Flight simulator and I have no clue what&rsquo;s going.
Craig
We&rsquo;re deep diving into a classic 1930s and 40s golden age of radio drama called.
Taylor
The shadow on Edge radio. No, no, no one.
Craig
Of them. And we are unpacking how this late 30s episode in particular sets up some really fascinating Oriental. Images of Asia that were commonplace in the West at that point because both of us have been getting into Cyberpunk 2077, and it has. The kind of 80s view of the Asian other. So we&rsquo;re looking at what the 1930s Asian other was. So in this case the antagonist is this kind of, you know, feminine presence. She&rsquo;s irrational. We&rsquo;ll skip to the end where this kind of barbaric. Other is coming into place because the shadow of course, is a rational, civilised, masculine figure, whereas Ali bin Laden is an irrational, barbaric, feminine figure. So let&rsquo;s listen to the end as the final conflict occur. So basically leading up to this, we&rsquo;ve had a series of story beats. If we&rsquo;re breaking this down instead of in terms of Blake Snyder&rsquo;s classic, save the cat narrative, the theme gets stated there, right? The shadows power. Of invisibility and hypnotic suggestion seems to have met its match in Ali bin Laden right. The snake charmer seems to understand what what his power set is. It seems to have a deeper understanding of it. Possibly. Yeah, right. So there&rsquo;s a setup, the catalyst. There&rsquo;s a murder that occurs at the end of Act one, which then draws the shadow in to try and solve what this murder is about. It&rsquo;s linked to the drug trade that&rsquo;s going on. Then the reveal is that Ali been in such.
Taylor
Bin laden. And you&rsquo;re gonna say it, Osama bin Laden.
Craig
Bin Laden has this necklace that has the temple bells of naban in it, right? It&rsquo;s twinkle thing that will basically counter the shadow. Those ability to become invisible. All right. Again, all kind of mystery as to how that occurs. There&rsquo;s a bit of fun and games. The shadow looks like the bad guys are closing in on him. And how is he going to?
Speaker 7
M.
Craig
Counteract the power set of the antagonist. All seems to be lost. We hit The Dark Knight of the soul points, or it seems that the shadow won&rsquo;t be able to defeat her because he can&rsquo;t use his normal hidden skill advantage that he&rsquo;s going to dig deeper.
Speaker 7
Hmm.
Craig
To outsmart her. And then we head into this finale where the the character of Sada bin Laden Ada is defeated. So let&rsquo;s jump into that now and we&rsquo;ll have a listen to that, and then we&rsquo;ll break it down in terms of. Some of the key orientalist tropes.
Speaker 11
No one can get through those, not even a shell. Save your love, whoever you are, we&rsquo;ve got you. You&rsquo;re in this cabin somewhere, and this ship is outward bound. Laugh that.
Speaker 1
I think you may have made three mistakes, Captain. One too many. Yes, captain.
Speaker 3
But I do not make mistakes that.
Speaker 1
That remains to be seen, Zade villada.
Speaker 3
Then you will see. And with the weaker basket like.
Speaker 14
What do? You want to do? Yes, daddy.
Speaker 3
I call the temple bell the Niban captain. The shadow has the power to blind your eyes, but trick he learned in India from a Yogi who was my uncle. But I have a better trip. When the last bell sounds, while the sacred Cobra dancing, you will see the shadow only at the man. Be ready to shoot, Captain.
Speaker 11
I&rsquo;m ready.
Speaker 3
And now my cobra to dance with the bells of Nevada.
Speaker 1
I wouldn&rsquo;t open that basket if I were you, Sadie Villada.
Speaker 3
You watch my pretty COBRA sale. He may find you even before the captain&rsquo;s bullets. You will die just as quickly.
Speaker 1
Dead cobras are better plaything than live ones.
Speaker 3
Make your small prayer style. And now my pretty one, digging good done.
Phoebe
Be careful.
Speaker 11
The Cobra moves towards you.
Speaker 3
My own pretty cobra, he knows me. You hear the bell shadow? The temple bell.
Speaker 1
I hear them.
Speaker 3
When the last cell right? We shall see our prisoner.
Speaker 11
And I am waiting for that minute. I&rsquo;m sorry.
Speaker 17
Sadly.
Speaker 15
Sorry.
Speaker 1
The shadow warned you, Sade bin Laden.
Speaker 11
You take credit, but they still.
Speaker 1
Do you know? They should have known it was not her cobra in the Wicker basket. It was mine.
Phoebe
Use.
Speaker 14
Dead.
Speaker 11
What&rsquo;s that? Who is it?
Speaker 17
The police reported. No. Please. Captain Malin, you do not shoot.
Craig
All right. And that&rsquo;s not the police breaking into the studio. We&rsquo;re not being taken off air by a sudden interruption of the police. But at the end of the 1930. 8 episode. Of the shadow called the temple bells of Naban, I do like that moment where I mean, maybe on the comments for this video of the temple built, many people complained that the the character of Sada Bernarda is is really good. It&rsquo;s a good foil to the shadow because again, much like there&rsquo;s Orientalist. Oops, it&rsquo;s the antithesis. While the shadow is this rational masculine figure. You are kind of hyper rational here. We have this kind of mystical, seductive female dangerous other. Who can confront him? Who can call him out on his mysticism? Because she&rsquo;s trained in the same stuff and better at it with her snake. So of course, how does he get around? How does he get around the snake? He uses his rational detective skills to switch out the snake, and she is. Then bitten by her own hubris, her own feeling that she has power over the snake. To to die and. Unfortunately, killed off as a as a as a. Villain. Yeah, in that episode. Yes. So we have some nice kind of mysticism, heavy preparation of the eastern wisdom idea. I reckon you could do a counter reading of that where instead of. You know, like the the rise of the the colonial oppressed because obviously here we have the the colonial appropriation of knowledge that the the the skill of Lamont is that idea that he&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s gone to India, Tindall. These skills the West has absorbed eastern wisdom. But stripped it. Of all its context, right and reduced it down to, you know, just a kind of, you know, in terms of. The antagonist kind of villainous backwards character, but you could convert that she could, you know, triumph for the other. Possibly. I mean it&rsquo;s one of the limitations I guess, of the Western imagining that this is very much the western point of view. Would an Indian story be different, you know where the shadow is actually the bad guy?
Taylor
So at the moment my mind is just drifting away from what you&rsquo;re saying because you were talking about East and West and then that just reminded me of when we were in Japan together and we had cheats.
Craig
OK.
Taylor
Always cheater. That was at KFC, KFC and we had chicken pizza.
Speaker 11
Yes, right.
Taylor
When my mind was.
Craig
Going well. Look. Yeah, I think that&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s an interesting point in terms of I think that. Yeah. OK. So I think that&rsquo;s really a good point to end on. Yeah, because what I find really fascinating is here we have Western stories about Asia, right? So the character. Of the shadow. Is he refers to India, he refers going to India becoming mystical. We&rsquo;re introduced to an Indian character, the snake charmer, dance woman. But it&rsquo;s not written from their point of view right? Then you can have.
Speaker 17
Hmm.
Craig
Moments where what does that? Subjective other. In this case India. But in our case, Japan. Do when it takes the West. Yeah. Right. So for the KFC Western food. They don&rsquo;t treat it as what we would eat in the West. They recombined it, rehydrated it into a chicken pizza.
Speaker 7
Yeah, yeah.
Taylor
Chicken pizza pizza.
Craig
Pizza and next week we might get around to it if we have some time with the idea of Cyberpunk 2077 equally was started as. Western imaging. Of the rise of power in Asia. So you had a dominant Japanese automobile industry in the 70s. You had a dominant Japanese economy that was in many ways fearful from the West, right? The West was seeing it as a power source. That it couldn&rsquo;t. Triumph against sins in terms of automobile. Sales, technology quality and other things. So they started doing this cyberpunk stuff about what a horrible, dystopic world this is headed into, but then you have Akira Ghost in the Shell films made in Japan for a Japanese audience, which instead of taking the kind of, you know, where I kind of subjugated other, recenter it as they&rsquo;re the main characters in that. That Orientalist fantasy and.
Taylor
What reminds me what? What does? What does? What does Vietnam do when the West goes into view?
Craig
Yes. Yeah, all these and more.
Taylor
Because because because the French go go.
Craig
In Yep, the colonial.
Taylor
Period. And then Vietnam takes the baguettes and the mayonnaise and puts it everywhere. Yeah.
Craig
Right. So one can have these hybrid cuisine moments. Yeah. Yeah. Look, and I think food is probably the most constructive. Globalised. Yeah. Consequence like the chica role in anyway is going way off topic. Now, the chica you never had.
Speaker 3
What is that?
Craig
A chica roll. Baby.
Taylor
It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s kind of like.
Craig
For. It&rsquo;s a spring roll, but it&rsquo;s.
Taylor
Yeah, spring roll, but done in like a a more a more pastry.
Speaker 7
Yeah, it&rsquo;s.
Craig
Yeah. It&rsquo;s like a combination. Of a yeah, pasty and a spiral, yeah. Anyway, way off topic.
Taylor
No. Corn jacks are better, actually. They&rsquo;re filled with corn instead.
Craig
So that&rsquo;s a. Little start in terms of us starting to explore ideas of Orientalism today.
Taylor
Cyberpunk. Cyberpunk. Cyberpunk.
Craig
Yeah. We&rsquo;re gonna go into the techno Orientalism in coming weeks, so keep listening to.
Taylor
Ohh, we&rsquo;ve got. We&rsquo;ve got another. Comment. Comment. Yeah, not on the actual request line.
Craig
Oh, right, right. Yep. Thank you for that. Interesting. So the comment reads interesting to touch on the cyberpunk theme from the Western Japanese perspective. Ken. Yes, thank you, Ken. Exactly. So that I think is a really rich area where we can see storytelling happening at both ends, both the western view of Asia, particularly Japan in cyberpunk.
Speaker 7
Hmm.
Craig
And then later on we can see the reappropriation of that discourse in anime like Akira and Ghost in the Shell, which does something completely different with those same motifs of, you know, body modification through technology and the rise of Asian power in multinational companies. That&rsquo;s.
Taylor
Yep.
Craig
Alright. Yep. OK. So we&rsquo;re we&rsquo;re really at time now. Thanks for listening everyone. I hope you found that deep dive into the shadow. Interesting do listen to. The shadow. It&rsquo;s fascinating. Series then.
Taylor
Well, yeah, well, you know.
Craig
As the actors themselves said, I mean maybe falling to sleep to it, listen to you&rsquo;re going to fall asleep to you&rsquo;re on a long drive. There&rsquo;s some really quality storytelling, but you need to understand it&rsquo;s for audio. So there are those corny moments where they&rsquo;re over explaining the physicality of it. Like that scene where she&rsquo;s saying.
Speaker 11
Yeah.
Craig
Ohh, there&rsquo;s a snake coming out of the basket and you notice how the snake is moving side by side following the arms is so they&rsquo;re.
Taylor
They&rsquo;re they do it, they do it a lot more better in more modern things, so.
Phoebe
But.
Taylor
And. No. Yeah, like with Big Finish Doctor Who.
Craig
Story. Yes. Yeah, yeah. So the storytelling, you know, has has increasingly become more and more effective. Yes. All right. That&rsquo;s the medium mothership for another week. Thanks for listening. In next week, we&rsquo;ll jump into some more. Stuff. Thanks again for all those that are commenting. Taylor will decide how to deal with those comments as they come through.
Taylor
Punk. Ohh dear. So no, I&rsquo;m not going to respond to that. Probably not, yeah.
Craig
And I was like, listening next week, we&rsquo;re research, time permitting, we&rsquo;ll dive into techno Orientalism and cyber.
Taylor
Let me research, time permitting, I&rsquo;m 100% talking about it next.
Speaker 7
Time.
Craig
Week, OK, OK. There we go, guaranteed.
Taylor
Thanks. Yeah.

<p>Using Blake Snyder&rsquo;s (2005) framework from <em>Save the Cat</em>, along with media theories from Slavoj &#381;i&#382;ek and Stuart Hall, we will uncover the compelling story structure and the unstoppable horror tropes it embodies. We will also examine its cultural impact through insights from Stephen King&rsquo;s analysis of radio horror and Bill Cosby&rsquo;s comedic retelling.</p>

      Craig
Alright, welcome here to media mothership here on Edge Radio 99.3 FM.
Speaker 3
What made half life, Alex there we.
Speaker
OK. Yeah.
Craig
Go. Yes. Alright. So as always, we&rsquo;re using the wonderful technology from Edge Radio studios here at Nepal, Luna, Hobart TAS. And I&rsquo;m your host, Craig. On this show, we explore how media can cheap our understanding of the world around us. Last week we took a deep dive into various parts of pop culture, including some and. Or Star Wars? Stuff and a little bit of discussion of anime as well as some news and current pop culture topics. Today&rsquo;s topic we&rsquo;re going to do a huge deep dive into. Horror and radio. I came across some really fascinating discussion from Stephen King in his book dance Macabre, talking about the impact of radio, effectively conveying horror. So we&rsquo;re going to listen to a classic short 7 minute. Horror. Drama called Chicken Hearts Chicken Heart the most unlikely of things that could drive horror into the heart of a listener. So we listen to that. Some people might also know of chicken heart from the fantastic, though now problematic Bill Cosby sketch that he did in one of his early live up. Live stand up albums we&rsquo;ll we&rsquo;ll. Unpack all of that. That and a whole bunch of other stuff on media mothership today, but the main question is, you know, this, this, this idea of how it has seven minute radio drama from 1937 can still I, I reckon haunt pop culture today. I reckon there&rsquo;s some. Lessons and some interesting. Political reverberations that chicken hearts. Echoes with today&rsquo;s politics, particularly the news we&rsquo;re hearing out of California and the kind of. Trump military police crackdown that&rsquo;s going on there I. Think there&rsquo;s chicken heart? Is in conversation with even scary politics like that today. So keep listening to. Media mothership with myself Craig here on Edge Radio, 99.3 FM. Of course. If you do have any comments while we&rsquo;re doing today, show you can SMS US directly in the studio on 0488811707 or reach out to us via the live stream. On YouTube and Twitch. OK, welcome back now. Musical accompaniment, the thumb, Hogan. Chicken hearts. So I guess to set up this idea of how a 7 minute radio drama from way back in 1937 still packs a punch. Or does it?
Speaker
We&rsquo;ll, we&rsquo;ll, we&rsquo;ll.
Craig
Look a little bit about the history first of it, why this kind of? Matters so chicken Hearts broadcast 1937. It&rsquo;s written by one of the big names in radio dramas, particular horror Arch Oboler, and he wrote for the radio drama series mainly lights out. We&rsquo;ll listen to the Bill Cosby sketch, which kind of amps up the experience of watching. Or sorry, of listening to radio dramas like Light Sounds briefly before we dive into listening to it, the the story of Chicken Heart is is basically a scientific experiment which goes horribly wrong. You know, it starts with this idea of a checking. And then as we&rsquo;ll hear. Things escalate into this crazy panic. To put it in a little bit of context, I guess you got to understand that at the time this was written in the 1930s, you&rsquo;ve got this really cool, fascinating glimpse into some of the I reckon the key anxieties. That were echoing or that were occurring in that time in the late 30s. Think about it. I mean, here we are pretty much in the Golden Age of radio in the 30s. You know, television has certainly not. Made an impact, right? You you really needing to earn to the 50s and 60s? Nineteen 30S was still dominated by radio. Radio was the form of of popular entertainment and communication and a series like lights, Lights out. And this is one of the early episodes. From it is part of what was making radio drama something so exciting for people to listen into. Now, importantly, some of you. Guys might have. Heard of the classic media panic radio drama that was Orson Welles? War of the world? That was the one, of course, that led to a huge panic around the power of media and radio to again shape the way people perceived reality around them. You know, war of the worlds based on HD World&rsquo;s Classic novel was broadcast in radio, formed by Orson Welles and done in such a manner. That people thought the live broadcast that was occurring was actually happening. And again it did that by echoing some of the broadcasts that were happening at that point from the. Blitz that was occurring on England during World War Two from the German air bombings and evoking that sense of disaster, the Hindenburg disaster, which was broadcast on radio. So again this. Chicken heart occurs one year, so it&rsquo;s broadcast to one year before war of the Worlds, but I think it sets up the same type of media panic and certainly Bill Cosby&rsquo;s comedy sketch about his experience listening to Chicken Heart is all about. The media panic he experienced listening to chicken heart. So we&rsquo;ll play a little bit of that Bill Cosby thing as well as the Stephen King analysis of Chicken Heart shortly. But before we go any further, the other thing to listen out for I guess is this idea that in the 1930s you got to see this movement of of kind of science and medicine. That&rsquo;s going through incredibly rapid advancements. You know, we&rsquo;ve only had flights occurring, you know, in the 1913 era. So 1930s is only 20 years after flights. You&rsquo;ve got the expansion of a number of technologies, including radio itself. Of. So. Chicken Heart is is kind of in conversation with some of these fears and you know, kind of technological determinism that is taking up around science at the moment. The kind of humorous of science and 37, I mean, while World War 2 hasn&rsquo;t occurred yet, that won&rsquo;t be until 1939. And Germanys&rsquo;s invasion of Poland. Nevertheless, you&rsquo;ve still got. What is it? I think the Marco Polo incidents occurred with Japan and China launching that conflict between Japan going through into China. So we&rsquo;re really at the brink of World War 2 during this time. I mean, there&rsquo;s a lot of of of stress that&rsquo;s occurring here. I mean, Hitler&rsquo;s in power, Hitler&rsquo;s starting to gobble up little spots. I&rsquo;m not sure if Czechoslovakia. Or so Dayton land has fallen into Germany yet, but it&rsquo;s right around that period. You&rsquo;ve got Chamberlain, you&rsquo;ve got piercement occurring. We&rsquo;re at the brink of war, right? It&rsquo;s certainly gearing up. So I think this, this theme that we&rsquo;ll hear about in chicken heart of. And unstoppable destructive force. Is is certainly. I think in conversation with that point in history, so a little bit of media induced panic. So as you&rsquo;re listening to this, think about, you know, if you turn the lights out literally the name of the horror serial, this is broadcast in it&rsquo;s lights out. So turn those lights out. Listen to this episode. Think about whether it could induce a bit of panic. What&rsquo;s also interesting about? The final point about chicken heart before we listen to. Is, as we&rsquo;ll unpack. The fact that you&rsquo;ve got some really memorable comedy interpretations. Yeah, Bill Cosby&rsquo;s famous retelling as well as it being in Stephen King&rsquo;s book dance Macabre, which is his analysis of horror as a genre, what makes horror work. And he talked specifically about chicken heart. So let&rsquo;s give a listen now to the 1937 chicken heart. This has been remastered again. It&rsquo;s a classic from radio. Horror. And created by Arch Uber. You know one of the big masters of. Terror that we&rsquo;ll listen to. So here is chicken heart. We&rsquo;ll play the whole thing. It only goes to 7 minutes. 40 seconds. So sit back, enjoy, grab a coffee or tea and listen to chicken heart.
Speaker 4
Do you remember some time ago in an eastern scientific institution? They kept the peace of heart alive for weeks on end. Well, I got to thinking, what if that heart began to grow? And grow and grow. Grow.
Speaker 5
Hello. Hello. Operator. Give me Mr Reagan fast. Hello, Mr Reagan. This is Lewis. Listen, get me a rewrite, man. The things still growing. No cheap. I tell you the truth. That corridors choked with living, crawling flesh. No, no, no, I&rsquo;m not drunk. I&rsquo;m telling you the truth. That little piece of flesh has grown until now. It&rsquo;s. Jamming that building. All inside the space of an hour. You&rsquo;ve got to believe me. It&rsquo;s the greatest news story of the generation. And here you argue with me. I tell you, it&rsquo;s the truth. You&rsquo;ve got to believe in you.
Speaker 3
You must believe me, I tell you, the only hope is to burn the building to. The ground that one. Now, wait a minute. Wait. A minute. Take it. I tell you. Burn it to the. Ground burn and I tell you, take it. Easy. I sent in a call. Don&rsquo;t you understand? For some reason I cannot even imagine, this tissue is doubling in size every hour. Do you know what that means? In another hour it will be twice the size it is now, and long before that it will break open the building with the force of its pressure, and then it will be free in the street. Do you hear me? Free. On the street and then those those tentacles of protoplasm stretching out to feed on anything they can reach.
Speaker 6
What&rsquo;s happening? You see the walls cracking? They want. I want you.
Speaker 3
I tried to warn them. But now it is too late. The heart is free.
Speaker 8
Where is it?
Speaker 7
Gentlemen, gentlemen, come to order. Please, gentlemen. Please. Quiet, quiet, please. Please. Please now as mayor, no one realises more than I do the necessity of immediate action in terming this unspeakable unbelievable emergency. Can I assure you that I.
Speaker 8
I cut the speeches, Mike, that blasted thing is spreading like a forest fire. All the governor.
Speaker 7
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, Please wait here. Is Doctor Albert from the Research Institute. Speak. Step up here. Doctor, do so.
Speaker 9
Aaron.
Speaker 10
Let&rsquo;s see what he says.
Speaker 3
Gentlemen. It was in my institute this horror began. And if you give me a chance, perhaps I can stop it. What is your?
Speaker 7
Doctor, tell us first what that monster really is, yes.
Speaker 3
Yes, I will tell you that great ever growing mass of flesh it is or it was a chicken heart.
Speaker 7
Hard. Are you crazy?
Speaker 5
Men.
Speaker 7
Yes. Chicken heart. Chicken heart. Listen to me, you fool. Listen, listen. Up there, who knows what he&rsquo;s talking about.
Speaker 3
I tell you that mass of flesh was a chicken heart, the tissue of which for some reason is undergoing constant, rapid, accelerating growth with every passing hour, its growth is doubling. Do you know what that means? If it is now one block in size within 30 hours, that cannibal flesh will have increased in size. To 1 square block to the 30th power in 30 hours. Every inch of this whole city will be crushed under that moving. Within 60 hours it will have covered the entire state within two weeks, the entire United States. You ask for the National Guard. I say call out the entire army. We&rsquo;ll ask this thing off the earth.
Speaker 8
Already Keith pumpers already all hoses coupled up. We&rsquo;ll flood that thing with water from all.
Speaker 10
Angles alright, here&rsquo;s the signal.
Speaker 7
Open them up full blast.
Speaker 8
Chief work out. That&rsquo;s reaching out. Get back everybody, everybody.
Speaker 3
Is what good is water? I told them the only hope is artillery. Bums.
Speaker 10
All National Guardsmen report to your armouries. All National Guardsmen report to your armouries. General mobilisation.
Speaker 8
Battery in position, Sir.
Speaker 10
Firing on the album.
Speaker 7
Sir.
Speaker 11
Then.
Speaker 3
Aye.
Speaker 9
Hi here.
Speaker 3
Useless. It has grown too large and it grows too quickly. The flesh is already engulfing the guns. They came too late.
Speaker 5
You all right now, Doctor Albert? Yes.
Speaker 3
Yes, I&rsquo;m all right, Mr. Lewis.
Speaker 5
Well, I sure am glad I located you. I stole as long as I could. Another 10 minutes and we could have taken off that blasted protoplasm or whatever it is was sucking at the wheels by the. Time we left the. Yes, yes, I saw 5000 feet. Well, we&rsquo;ll cruise around up here for a few minutes and. Then head W it will.
Speaker 3
Do no good.
Speaker 5
You can&rsquo;t mean it it it must stop growing sometime it must.
Speaker 3
Look at it down there. The grey blankets of evil covering. See how the roads are black with men and women and their children running for their lives. See how the protoplasmic grave reaches out and engulfs them. See.
Speaker 5
Stop it. Stop talking like that. We&rsquo;ll get away the government. They&rsquo;ll send bombing planes, poison gas.
Speaker 3
No. Listen to me, Lewis. You remember only a handful of days ago you asked me my prophecy of the end of the. With you remember my answer? Ohh such a scholarly prophecy. Cessation of Earth rotation. Mighty sounding astronomical theories. But now this is reality. Lewis. The end has come for humanity. Not in the red of atomic fusion. Not in the glory of interstellar combustion. Not in the piece of white. Hold silence, but with that, that creeping, grasping flesh below us. It is a joke. Hey, Lewis, a great joke. The joke of the cosmos. The end of mankind.
Speaker 6
No.
Speaker 11
Oh.
Speaker 3
Because of the chickens.
Speaker 9
No, we won&rsquo;t die. I can&rsquo;t die. I&rsquo;ll find a safe landing somewhere. I&rsquo;ll find a place. The motor. It&rsquo;s cut out. We&rsquo;re a spin. I can&rsquo;t get.
Speaker 3
Out of it, I told you, doom. No, no mankind. Doom. No.
Speaker 9
We&rsquo;re falling right into it, into the heart.
Craig
All right. There we have it. The chicken heart. One of the classic all time horror. Radio dramas. Let&rsquo;s break this down first in terms of bleak Snyders see if the cat theory or script writing we&rsquo;ve. Looked at black, bleak. Snyder, before he has proposed a number of ways in which, if you want to write a great movie, there&rsquo;s. Specific number of story beats. You&rsquo;ve gotta make sure you tick off. Let&rsquo;s see if breaking down. Chicken hearts align strongly and reveals this kind of classic story build building structure that saves the cat is built around, so Snyder starts with the idea that you&rsquo;ve got to start strongly with a good opening image. You&rsquo;ve got to establish the world through that so. The radio drama Chicken Heart starts with the scientist talking about, you know, remember when they were able to create a heart. So establishing the idea of science, establishing the idea of science, being able to create amazing things. And this idea of hubris, right, that we&rsquo;re we&rsquo;re setting up this. Environment this this world where humans are masters over nature, they&rsquo;re able to create anything they want, including a heart. So that&rsquo;s the establishing image that first seen and we quickly go to the reporter setting up the theme, which is the report is calling back to his office. With a panic tone staying, you know? Ohh my God. It&rsquo;s about to explode, right? The building that the heart was in as as, as you know, the the the heart&rsquo;s been growing, it&rsquo;s going to burst the walls and we have the scientists trying to warn everyone that this thing is just going to keep growing. So that&rsquo;s kind of setting up this theme of of scientific ambition and and panic. Around the consequences if they become uncontrollable, so that that&rsquo;s pretty much immediately the second scene we see that nicely as Snyder is saying, establishing the theme. You know panic. Scientific hubris, unchecked experiment, and then we have this setup as the hearts growing. We&rsquo;re becoming aware of it. The fourth story beat that Snyder talks about is is an inciting incident. And it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s around I guess the the walls have broken from the building that contain the hearts. So I&rsquo;d say that&rsquo;s probably the scene that&rsquo;s the inciting incident. The fact that this heart is now growing uncontrollably, that&rsquo;s the catalyst that then sets up the rest of the story, which is how are we going to stop this heart? Growing. Right. What&rsquo;s going on? They&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re. They&rsquo;re now realising that this scientific experiment is spiralling out of control, so we have seen five. Well story 5, which is the debate. Can it be stopped? So we have this classic scene where scientists, the mayors there and they&rsquo;re all struggling to figure out how they&rsquo;re going to fix this. They&rsquo;re debating. Possible solutions? So we break now into Act 2. This is storytelling .6, which is the point of no return, right? So at this point the heart has continued to escape containment. We have the great scene. Where the local authorities are trying to use water, right, they&rsquo;ve got the hoses out and they&rsquo;re just trying to hose it down and it&rsquo;s not working right. So there&rsquo;s a sense of dread that&rsquo;s creeping in that the world now is in full crisis mode. Water is not worked. The scientist has said, I told the fools what wouldn&rsquo;t work. They&rsquo;ve got to use artillery and bombs. Alright. So then we move into storytelling beat 7, which is fun and games. As the horror escalates. You&rsquo;ve got the great scenes of that, you know, artillery being called in, the bombs being directed, the militaries involved, all these escalating panic movements as they&rsquo;re futilely, they&rsquo;re futile, ISM, they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re not able to destroy the heart with any of the fun and games. That Snyder refers to as this story beat as we see a series of of kind of kind of core horror spectacles being described to us in the radio drama. There&rsquo;s no real sense of well, there&rsquo;s a kind of a false hope, right? So the false hope would be that scene near the end where the scientist is on the. The aeroplane, right. We had that scene where the his, his assistant or or helper has managed to get the aeroplane off the ground. The scientist that was involved in the research has made it onto that aeroplane and. And it. It&rsquo;s a kind of midpoint, false hope moment where it looks like they might be able to get out of it. Right. So the pilots say, you know, we&rsquo;ll just circle around a bit. We&rsquo;ll try to figure out what to do next. But that effort is all in fail because we&rsquo;re at Story Week 9, which is the bad guys closing right this chicken heart, the bad guy, the villain, the force of Nature has continued to expand. The scientist in the aeroplane is just saying it&rsquo;s all hopeless. Destruction is inevitable. Story bit 10 all is lost, right? There&rsquo;s a final realisation, right? The the pilots refusing to acknowledge this. I know I can&rsquo;t die now. This can&rsquo;t happen. But who&rsquo;s lost? And we&rsquo;re now into a full dystopic, pessimistic story with story beat 11 dark night of the soul. So the scientist and the pilots in the aeroplane now confronts their powerlessness, right? And the scientist. Kind of reflects on his own humour. This, and we reached this wonderful kind of finale right where the growth of the hearts being recognised as impossible to stop this kind of ultimate horror is being seen below them. He&rsquo;s talking about the grey heart, the little black dots of people trying to escape. We have the finale where this height is is is consuming everything and that that theme of that we established in scene one with the reporters cooling his base at the scientists saying, you know, those fools have got to listen to. Me that these unchecked forces are now beyond human control, with a wonderful final image.
Speaker 1
Which is a.
Craig
Sound effect image, of course. For radio of the splats of the the aeroplane losing its engine right and spiralling out of control, and this wonderful final sound of the SPLAT as the aeroplane crashes into the heart. So it&rsquo;s certainly a really strong. Story in terms of breaking it down in those fourteen save the cat story beats in terms of where Snyder would place this as a genre. As you know, he he defines genres in terms of specifically memorable thought. So it&rsquo;s not a horror genre. He would say this is a monster in the house. Subgenre right where you have this unstoppable force, right. The monster in the house, which is just wreaking havoc in this case due to human error. Right, the scientists tubers. And it&rsquo;s got that classic structure that follows the kind of escalating tension and inevitable doom story. So it&rsquo;s considered a classic of being able to map that out. It&rsquo;s a wonderful kind of inevitable doom. 7 minutes, 7 1/2. And it&rsquo;s packs in a lot. And again, Bill Cosby&rsquo;s little comedy routine on his experience as a child listening to this drives that home. But before you get to Bill Cosby, let&rsquo;s listen to how Stephen King, the well known horror author, explains why he thinks. Chicken heart matters. And it&rsquo;s really important to listen to, even to it now. So this is in Stephen King&rsquo;s dance macabre book, which is his writing about why horror works, how it works in movies, how it works in literature, and what we&rsquo;re going to be hearing about is, is a little snippet from the audio book. Created by William Derfus derfus. So we&rsquo;ll listen to hear Steven you talking about the importance of radio horror and in particular, the author of it, Arch Ublas. Chicken heart.
Speaker 1
3. We&rsquo;re almost done with our brief discussion of radio. Now. I think that to do much more would be to risk droning along like one of those tiresome cinema buffs want to spend the night telling you how Charlie Chaplin was the greatest screen actor who ever lived, or that the Clint Eastwood spaghetti Westerns stand at the apex of the existential absurdist movement. But no discussion of the phenomenon of radio terror, no matter how brief, would be complete without some mention of the genres Primo 2. Not Orson Welles, but Arch Oboler, the first playwright to have his own National Radio series, the chilling Lights out. Lights out was actually broadcast in the 40s, but enough of the programmes were rebroadcast in the 50s and even in the 60s. For me to feel I can justify their inclusion here. The one I remember most vividly from its rebroadcast on Dimension X was the chicken heart that ate the world oboler like so many people in the horror field, Alfred Hitchcock, as another prime example, are extremely alert to the humour implicit in horror, and this alertness was never on better view than in the chicken. Art story made you giggle at its very absurdity, even as the goose flesh raced up and down your arms.
Speaker
Which?
Speaker 1
You remember that only a few days ago you asked me my opinion on how the world would end. The scholarly scientist who is unwittingly perpetrated the horror on an unsuspecting world solemnly tells his young protege as they fly at 5000 feet in a light plain over the ever growing chicken heart. You remember my answer. Uh, such a scholarly prophecy. Mighty sounding theories about cessation of Earth, rotation, entropy, but now this is reality, Lewis. The end is come for humanity. Not in the red of atomic fusion, not in the glory of interstellar combustion. Not in the piece of white cold silence. But with that, that creeping, grasping flesh below us.
Speaker 12
It was a joke. Gay Lewis. The joke of the cosmos, the end of mankind because of a chicken heart.
Speaker 1
No Louis jibbers. No, I can&rsquo;t die. I&rsquo;ll find a safe landing place. But then, perfectly on cue, the comforting drone of a planes engine in the background becomes a coughing stutter. We&rsquo;re in a spin, Lewis screams.
Speaker 12
The end of all mankind.
Speaker 1
The doctor proclaims and stentorian tones and the two of them falled directly into the chicken heart. We hear it. Steady, beat louder, louder, and then the sickly splash that ends the play. Part of Obler&rsquo;s real genius was that when Chicken Heart ended, you felt like laughing and throwing up at the same time. Cue the bombers, an old radio bit used to run drone of bombers in the background. The minds eye visualises a sky black with flying forts. Dropped the ice cream into Puget Sound. The voice continues. Whining hydraulic sound of Bombay&rsquo;s opening a rising whistle followed by a gigantic splash. All right. Cue the chocolate syrup, the whipped cream. And drop the maraschino cherry. Is. We hear a great liquid squishing sound as the chocolate syrup goes, then a huge hissing as the whipped cream follows. These sounds are followed by a heavy plop, plop, plop in the background. And, absurd as it may be, the mind responds to these cues that interior eye actually sees a series of gigantic ice cream sundaes rising out of Puget Sound like strange volcanic. Stones, each with a maraschino cherry the size of Seattle&rsquo;s Kingdom. On top of it. In fact, we see those disgustingly red cocktail cherries raining down, plopping into all thou whipped cream and leaving craters nearly the size of great Tycho. Thank the genius of Stan Freberg. Arch Oboler A restlessly intelligent man who was also involved in. Movies 5 one of the first films to deal with the survival of Mankind after World War 3 was Obler&rsquo;s brainchild. And the legitimate theatre utilised 2 of radios. Great strengths. The first in the minds innate obedience, its willingness to try to see whatever someone suggests it see, no matter how absurd the second is, the fact that fear and horror are blinding emotions that knock our adult pins from beneath us. That leave us groping in the dark like children who cannot find the light. Radio is, of course, the blind medium, and only obler used it so well or so completely. Of course, our modern years pick up the necessary conventions of the medium that have been outgrown, mostly due to our growing dependence on the visual and our. Set of reality. But these were standard practises which audiences of the day had no trouble accepting. Like tornieri&rsquo;s paper mache, Rockwall and cat people. If these conventions seem jarring to listeners of the 80s, as the asides in a Shakespearean play seemed jarring to a novice playgoer, then that is our problem to work out as best we can. One of these conventions is the constant use of narration to move the story. A second is dialogue as description, a technique necessary to radio but one TV, and the movies have rendered obsolete. Here, for instance, from the chicken heart that ate the world is Doctor Albert&rsquo;s discussing the chicken heart itself with Louis. Read the passage and then ask yourself how true this speech rings to your TV and movie trained ears. Look at it down there. A great blanket of evil covering everything. See how the roads are black with men and women and their children fleeing for their lives. See how the protoplasmic grey reaches out and engulfs them. On TV, this would be laughed out of cord as total corn. It is not hip as they say. But heard in the darkness, coupled with the drone of the light planes engine in the background, it worked very well indeed. Willingly or unwillingly, the mind conjures up the image. Oboler wants this great Jelly like BLOB beating rhythmically, swallowing up the refugees as they run. Ironically, television in the early talkies both depended on the largely auditory conventions of radio. Until these, alright, we&rsquo;ll.
Craig
Post this that. Stephen King talking about why Chicken Heart works so well and how we really need to rewire ourselves to think about how. You know. Radio works as a theatre of the mind. How it doesn&rsquo;t draw upon the same types of suspension of disbelief that we&rsquo;ve become familiar with through TV and movies, where we want to visualise it. We want to see it. There&rsquo;s pleasure in the watching of it here. It&rsquo;s all in the minds eye and as king. Asks us when we listen to or read that last scene. That final scene of the scientists giving up hope and saying we&rsquo;re all doomed. And looking down at the pulsating, growing, fleshy heart. Again, he says, you know, this work to our TV is and his feeling is it&rsquo;s quite laughable. It wouldn&rsquo;t. So let&rsquo;s dive further into that idea of the theatre of the mind and how effectively it can work as kings setting out here. He&rsquo;s saying it&rsquo;s a really significant moment. To imagine through your mind&rsquo;s eye the theatre of the mind, which really. Is able to do. By listening to one of the other important cultural effects that chicken heart had on pop culture, and this is Bill Cosby&rsquo;s famous 1966 album Wonderfulness. Which was part of one of his. Live comedy acts and this is his famous discussion of chicken hearts. Of course, Bill Cosby famous. For you know. Fat, Alberts, Cosby, kids and so forth, and equally probably more infamous now for his criminal activities. And law cases against him and being found guilty of rape, SO1 can&rsquo;t unpack that from what we&rsquo;re about to hear, important to say, of course, and deeply problematic individual. People. But let&rsquo;s listen to this famous comedy routine he has, which I do think speaks to Stephen King&rsquo;s point around trying to understand how theatre of the mind works and how effective Arch Ogler was with chicken hearts at creating this. So let&rsquo;s listen now to a a little bit from the sketch. From the 1966 album Wonderfulness by Bill Cosby.
Speaker 11
Go ahead, scare me to. I&rsquo;m ready. I&rsquo;m ready. Scare me, man. Come on now. And welcome to. Lights. Ohh yeah, yeah, yeah, go ahead. Scare me. I was dumb enough to do whatever the guy said to do on the radio. Turn your lights off. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. To round, go on, scare me to death. I&rsquo;m ready. Tonight&rsquo;s episode is about a chicken heart. A chicken heart that ate up New York City. Yeah, go chicken heart. Go, go get him. Eat him up. Chicken heart scare me to death. I&rsquo;m. I&rsquo;m ready. I&rsquo;m ready. The Chicken heart was kept alive. 5. In a laboratory and of that special solution, half blood, half sodium solution, right? One day a careless janitor. Knock that over, he went to get away to clean it up. The chicken heart grew. 6 foot 5 inches and in search. Of human blood. The janitor came back, opened the door. Them up.
Speaker 9
What?
Speaker 11
Go get him chicken high. Go get him. Go get him. It moved out into the hallway, rang for the elevator.
Speaker 13
4th floor.
Speaker 11
Go get him chicken high. Go get him. You will. Moved out into the street. Ate up all the cabs. The Empire State Building. Ate up their jersey Turnpike. It&rsquo;s in your home state. It&rsquo;s outside of your door. And it&rsquo;s going to eat you up.
Speaker 13
Ohh, got my jello star spirited all over the floor. I set the sofa on fire. You won&rsquo;t come there smoking fire and jello. My father came in the house and what? 1000 sober doing on fire coming out of the chicken was gonna eat. OK, zip. What chicken are you talking about? Who went on the radio show? You the idiot. Turn it off.
Speaker 11
I hadn&rsquo;t thought of that. For two years, anybody that passed by our House.
Speaker 14
Hmm. My father, whether he knew him or not, would call him in. Hey, come on. I want to. Show you my dumb kid. Ohh and tell him you burn up $100 sofa and broke your father&rsquo;s arm. Save us from that.
Craig
So that&rsquo;s the classic 1966 Bill Cosby routine. Chicken hearts again, I think really putting you in the feeling of listening to that live. With a panic that can trigger into ones imagination. And of course, what&rsquo;s interesting here is, you know Bill Cosby. Acknowledging the again talking about how Stuart Hall would talk about the reading positions here, you&rsquo;ve got the dominant reading position of Chicken Heart, which is it&rsquo;s a really good Horror Story, right? It has this good escalating horror that&rsquo;s going to it, which interestingly, Bill Cosby sets up and in a really kind of fan fiction way. Actually embellishes and explains how the hearts started to grow. That a janitor accidentally knocked over some chemical the chemical got into the heart and just caused this unlikely growth of the heart that the scientists had had had kept alive. So one that you have the dominant reading, but then? You have, you know, Bill. Cosby, which is kind of doing his own, it&rsquo;s a. Version of that. For comedy effect, talking about, you know, if you if you took it literally, it suddenly becomes insane. It says it&rsquo;s weird that you would believe this suddenly. So much so that you&rsquo;d set. Lie to you&rsquo;re so fit to protect yourself, and again the whole absurdity of listening to the. Escalating horror that you you you&rsquo;re only listening to radio show yet it seems so real. It seems like it&rsquo;s happening so much like a year later. From this you&rsquo;ll have awesome wells or the world&rsquo;s broadcast, which notoriously led to people arming themselves, getting out of their homes to try to defend their communities. That that they. Were seeing this as real equally here for comedy Effect, Bill Cosby&rsquo;s comic retelling of it being that kind. Of you know. It&rsquo;s looking at it on paper, as Stephen King says, it&rsquo;s. Kind of laughable. How can this chicken heart be so terrifying? That is absurd. Yet it is this masterful, I think, combination of of of you know, comic, horror and and kind of over identifying with the fear as a Zizek, Zizek the philosopher. Would talk about this, this, this kind of humour that occurs with extreme. Year where the terror is so ratchet it up that it gets to a point of absurdity which you know is, I think, the heart of Bill Cosby&rsquo;s comedy routine there and and and also. Yeah. Obviously some listeners have have have registered that. Thanks Anna for smashing in. I&rsquo;m glad it was fun to listen to that on the way home in the car. Because yeah, I think it does hold up 1937. This broadcast was first made, but it&rsquo;s such an effective bit of. Of horror that it&rsquo;s. Worthy of of unpacking it and also looking at the cultural impact it&rsquo;s had, Steven. Being fantastic, one of the best horror authors, as well as Bill Cosby, turning it both into a bit of cultural touchstone to discuss. You know, Bill Cosby&rsquo;s 1966 community and dance macabre. What came out in the early 80s. So there you&rsquo;re looking at 20 year periods where this. Cultural touchstone of the 1937 radio drama You know still gets discussed and talked about. The other thing that&rsquo;s so interesting I think about.
Speaker
Yes.
Craig
The chicken heart is this idea of, you know, the the absurd logic of it, that the system that you see that&rsquo;s occurring around the chicken hearts, you know that, you know, the science system, the military system, the police system, the journalism system. All it does is kind of reinforces what they&rsquo;re trying to stop, right? So they&rsquo;re all trying to stop the growth of the chicken hearts. And again, this is what Zizek says is so powerful about horror stories that often they&rsquo;re these tales. Of trying to stop the threats and particularly where the story is, you know, the darks tea time of the soul, the kind of, you know, and we lose, it&rsquo;s about the system itself being broken, that the system itself is trying to stop the threat. But the more it tries to stop the threat, the worse the threat. That&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s bringing more amplification to the threat. And this is Isaac. &lsquo;S theory of how he sees. Some abuses of power occurring, some kind of logics of of of ideology, that are growing exponentially and out of control, that the system might have begun with good intentions, but as it&rsquo;s released some destructive force, the more that the system tries to stop that destruction. It in so. Amplifies it. So again, interesting kind of resonances. I think with Trump&rsquo;s response to California today, right? How is it that the system, you know, claims of trying to stop violence yet still escalate violence? Right. So this logic, this paradox between. Just like the chicken heart, the expanding Organism. Which is paradoxically, being accelerated by its growth as. More bombing is occurring. More attempts to destroy it is happening, so there&rsquo;s some really interesting philosophical questions that are occurring there as well as, as you know, Stephen King&rsquo;s pointing out a really master class in how to create a story in 7 1/2 minutes. That is about the escalation of horror, the escalation of terror that works so effectively in radio. So it&rsquo;s worth, you know if you&rsquo;ve got a bit of time going back listening to lights out, a great 1930s forties radio serial drama. We&rsquo;ve talked about other great moments in horror radio dramas like the thing on the FOURBLE board, which is more of a psychological horror. Chicken heart is pretty much. A fantastic example of more of your minimalist horror where the sound effects do all the heavy lifting for the for the panic, whereas the thing on the fourble board which is considered to be another great horror radio drama, really escalates that through this eerie narration. As the characters interact, listen back to our episode on. The thing on the forward board for more discussion on that. But yeah, we&rsquo;ll. Dip into some more radio drama and piece together why it still matters in future shows. Again, I hope you thought the chicken heart was a nice bit of timeless horror, and in particular, listen back to it. Think of how sound based. Fear works, and if it&rsquo;s still effective today as it was in 1937, turn those lights out and listen to it. And see if, umm, you know a true experience of horror isn&rsquo;t just about monsters, but maybe about our inability to control the unknown. So that&rsquo;s medium other for another week, we&rsquo;ll be taking a break next week as they do a little bit of field research up in Launceston to bring some new interesting. Freeze to the airwaves in a fortnight time so no show. Next Thursday the 19th of June. Thanks everyone for listening to me and mother shipments. Radio. You can listen back to other audio notes for the show on your podcast supplier of choice.

     There is nothing wrong with your radio.
Do not attempt to adjust the volume. We are controlling the broadcaster for the next hour. We will control all that you hear.
You are about to experience the knowledge and insights of the medium mothership.
Craig
All right, welcome here to Edge Radio 99.3 FM. You&rsquo;re now tuned in to media mothership, exploring everything in and around the world. Of media, as always, we explore how media can shape our world around us, hopefully giving us some critical tools to unpack that in our own daily viewing and listening experiences, we&rsquo;re streaming on edgeradio.org dot AU as well as on YouTube and Twitch. Just search for media matters. Chip, you can message us on the chat at YouTube or Twitch or shoot us an SMS. On 0488811707 I&rsquo;m your host, Craig Norris, and on today&rsquo;s show we&rsquo;ll cover some strange news stories around media cultures as well as diving further into our understanding on how to write evil characters. In popular culture and movies and TV, so all that and more coming up on media mothership. Alright, welcome back to a musical. Notes accompanying the transition to a little bit of strange news that I&rsquo;ve come across searching for bizarre oddities on the Internet with media cultures first article quite intriguing, posted to say the 28th of May. Oh, sorry. Yesterday 28th of May. In GameSpot reporting that a concept borrowed from video games leads to fusion energy, breakthrough, scientists have used collision detection, which has pioneered has been pioneered in video games to achieve. Huge efficiency gains. In nuclear fission. Yes, this article goes to discuss how. Well, the South Korean scientists have made this huge breakthrough in nuclear fission fusion. Sorry by adapting a concept from video game. Play and it&rsquo;s this collision detection algorithm, so this idea of collision detection is typically used in video games to simulate objects interacting with each other and through applying that video game. Algorithm or algorithms developed in video games around perfecting collision detection. They&rsquo;ve been able to get a 15 fold increase in computation speeds for predicting particle collisions in fusion reactions, so of course, I guess if we&rsquo;re talking about nuclear. Fusion. Which at its heart is this idea of particle collisions being able to have an effective algorithm that can predict and detect collisions is pretty critical. So as the article goes on to say, this advancement is crucial because fusion reactors. Require extremely high energy particles, and while collisions between particles are necessary, unintended collisions with reactor walls can destabilise the. Action by improving predictive capabilities, this innovation may lead to safer and more efficient fusion reactors, the article goes on to say that fusion energy, often seen as promising alternative to traditional nuclear fusion, fission faces challenges due to its. High energy requirements and expensive operational costs. However, recent breakthroughs such as this one. Continue to bring commercially viable fusion energy closer to reality. Commercially viable fusion energy. So rather than traditional nuclear fission. Here we&rsquo;re talking about fusion energy. Just trying to think about what video games have particularly good or have to, you know, kind of really crunched the numbers and the maths to get their collisions effectively. Down up to 11 I. I guess Grand Theft Auto 5, I mean that involves. A lot of guns, a lot of cars that are speeding, motorcycles that are speeding. It&rsquo;s quite a chaotic game. Grand Theft Auto 5, where you&rsquo;re, as the name suggests, able to commit all number of larcenies and crimes within which there are many explosions. We think crashing into each other probably. Really. Another great one would be Super Smash brothers. You know, you&rsquo;ve got a game geared around collisions there, as you&rsquo;re combatting against another player, probably actually the one I was thinking is the best. Collision. Algorithm creator is is the portal games where you&rsquo;re. Train not only to kind of use the portal technology to go from one spot to another, but but really that kind of precise physics calculations that are at the heart of that game in terms of how these different objects are going to interact with each other, what the different portals and surfaces will be. In fact, if we let&rsquo;s let&rsquo;s let&rsquo;s set the mood quickly in terms of how that is quite an effective. Example. Here&rsquo;s here&rsquo;s the here&rsquo;s a trailer for for Portal 2, a bit more ominous. Maybe. Let&rsquo;s hope they don&rsquo;t take. Necessarily this direction in. Fusion reactions. Those people that have played Portal 2 will know it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a very dystopic game.
Example Text
It&rsquo;s been a long time. How have you been? I think we can put our differences behind us. For science, you monster.
Craig
Put our differences behind us for science. You monster. So that was Portal 2. Of course, the next article I&rsquo;d like to go into IS, is is a kind of unusual one in terms of it&rsquo;s about a classic 1970s TV show, Gilligan&rsquo;s Island. We&rsquo;ll put ourselves in the mood in case you&rsquo;ve never seen the wonders of Gilligan&rsquo;s Island, I&rsquo;m sure. No worries, we&rsquo;ll remember this. Wonderful theme song.
Speaker 5
Trip that started from this topic, this tiny ship by passengers set sail that day. Three hour tour, a three hour tour.
Craig
So what&rsquo;s great about this intro is that it tells the story. Of this intrepid crew who are on a pleasure trip, and then they. Get. You know, swept off in a storm.
Speaker 5
Round on the shore.
Craig
Onto an island deserted island. About Gilligan, the skipper. The millionaire. And his wife.
Speaker 5
The star the professor, Marianne.
Craig
And the professor and Marianne. So what&rsquo;s interesting about this was an article reported in Cracked recently, which was going over some of the original show notes and the pitch. For this TV series way back in the 70s. And the initial pitch was a little more serious than the comic goofy oddball sitcom that Gilligan Island&rsquo;s got fondly remembered as the creator, Sherwood Schwartz. Presented his idea initially to CBS executives. As this social microcosm, which would explore how people from different societal backgrounds interact when stranded together, so a kind of sociological anthropological experiment in this. TV show and you know, I guess if we think about the characters that are in Gilligan&rsquo;s Island, you know, you&rsquo;ve got the skipper who&rsquo;s a kind of working class authority type guy, you know, symbolising this, you know, can do attitude, practical knowledge. The millionaire, you know, Thurston Howell the third? Yeah, this kind of 1 percenter, the wealthy elite of America and that privilege and status. The idea also that this character is kind of a little bit detached. From. The ability to actually survive in this world, right, that his his wealth has has protected him that that is the survival tasks. If they&rsquo;re not going to involve. And, you know, privilege aren&rsquo;t really going to make this character very useful. The movie star that&rsquo;s there, you know, representing that celebrity glamour vibe, particularly that 1960s allure of Hollywood, maybe the superficiality. That the shareowner was thinking that character could represent. 1960s and 70s. Interesting to think of the character of the professor. We&rsquo;re talking Cold War period here. So the idea of you know again, this this still utopia maybe of of faith around scientific progress. Right. You&rsquo;re in the middle of the space race during this period. Technological advancements seeming to be endless, so there are that professor character kind of symbolising that that utopic. Cold War era fate and scientific progression. Marianne, you know, forgettable character, but I guess that&rsquo;s what she is. She&rsquo;s a kind of every, every, every girl farm American girl, wholesome, hard working person, resilient. And then finally, Gilligan, you know, a bumbling, naive but well meaning. Every man. Often episodes, if you remember, involve a stupid thing he&rsquo;s done and then people trying to. Fix it but. Yeah, certainly a memorable character. Probably the one that is most fondly remembered. So anyway, that&rsquo;s those. Yeah, you could see pitch there that he initially gave. As social microcosms, what&rsquo;s interesting is crack.com has got a hold of some of the initial reactions to that were CBS executives at the time were very worried that this concept would be way too sophisticated for a comedy show. And indeed, what&rsquo;s interesting, though, is despite the fact that the showrunner, Sherwood Schwartz, pitched it as this maybe more complicated idea of social microcosms, the reactions to it were super harsh. The critical reaction was. Very brutal to towards Gilligan&rsquo;s Island, so I don&rsquo;t think the CBS executives had anything to worry about. In fact, most critics at the Times dismissed it as very absurd and poorly written. The actress that played the Hollywood starlet, Ginger Grant, said she was disappointed when she saw the first episodes feeling like it was more of a cartoon than a TV show. But of course, you know, did go on to become a classic. Amusingly, at the end of the article, the showrunner says. You know, after getting ripped apart by the critics as being as having created a a stupid show, you know, fondly remember fondly, you know, very popular, but nevertheless not the hypertension S initially was pitched at the showrunner said next year the intellectual critics will probably take another look at Gilligan&rsquo;s Island. Then they&rsquo;re right treaties on a social satire on many levels. So I have not come across in my own research any articles written on Gilligan&rsquo;s Island Society. At all. Confrontation with Cold War America. It&rsquo;s a great article in the making, though it&rsquo;s certainly something to probably circle back to. And yeah, maybe put something together as well. Next piece of news. OK, next piece of news. Yeah, one last article on Cracked funny piece. On these tail, it&rsquo;s like these tests like you do the batch stool test on a movie, you know which is all out trying to unpack. You know, ideological questions that are baked into a film. So the digital test has limitations. But I like the idea of it where you can assess the full roundedness of female characters by asking certain questions. Do the female characters. Talk about anything except for a male character. Various questions you can ask which start to at least you know well. They&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re a bit lacking of nuance. They will, they will still nevertheless get you to ask some interesting questions about film. Latest one is the Danny DeVito rule. Danny DeVito, of course, the 80s, nineties, various films he was in, he was. The. Who&rsquo;s in the Batman movie as the Penguin most commonly known now for always Sunny in. In Philadelphia, it&rsquo;s always sunny in Philadelphia. Will you please a really toxic Father character anyway? The the test here is the Danny DeVito rule is the best way to Judge ROM Coms. These are romantic comedy films and this was posted on Reddit. The idea being that. UM. Could you imagine in a romantic comedy? Tony de Vito&rsquo;s character, that is, you know, is is the romantic comedy actually effective? Right. If if the romcom is truly romantic, it should still work even if you cast. If you replace the male lead with a really toxic. Act or or performance. You know notoriously often delivered by Danny DeVito, or will that turn the film into a horror movie? Or an absurd comedy rather than a real romance. This rule, originally coined by a Reddit user way back in 2017, is part of a broader article highlighting how many romcoms rely more on conventional, attractive leads than genuine emotional connections. So the idea is if if it wasn&rsquo;t. Richard Gere. Here. Or you know Hugh Jackman in the role. If it was the quirky looking Danny DeVito, would it still work? And if it doesn&rsquo;t, does that suggest that the romantic comedy only worked because it was an attractive male lead and there weren&rsquo;t really any genuine emotional connections there? So there were a couple of films that I tested, like when Harry met Sally. Which it claims would pass the test. Other movies wouldn&rsquo;t like Gigi and. And yeah, it&rsquo;s an interesting idea. You know, taking an actor or a performance. And saying, you know what, if this was played by a different actor, that is diametrically. Aesthetically different or known for playing different roles, would that still work in this way? I wonder what other films you could have apply that to. One further little interesting piece let&rsquo;s. Talk now about, I guess a little bit away from media. Interesting article there on ABC News talking about how Starbucks in South Korea has banned the use of presidential candidate names for orders. So this was an unusual article talking about how much like in Starbucks. Everywhere when you order coffee, you can give your name. Many people were using that call. My name service after they make your beverage where they call your name to use the name of various failed presidential candidates or candidates that have since been impeached. So it seems, yeah, bizarre form of of censorship. I wonder what type of culture jamming, cultural resistance, political resistance was going on using these political names as the Starbucks order. And then, of course, it being banned. It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s truly, truly bizarre little piece of of news there. So that&rsquo;s this week&rsquo;s news discussion some, some intriguing little pieces of of news there. Let&rsquo;s now pick up where we were last week. Discussing how to write good villains. I want to look at this concept called the. Moment where in a movie The villain experiences. Comma, right? They&rsquo;re comeuppance. They&rsquo;re poetic justice that the villain faces where they get what they deserve, picking up from the guide to writing evil characters. Let&rsquo;s listen about this concept called the. Harmor deflector.
Speaker 5
To you.
Speaker 6
It&rsquo;s said in a lot of the magical, mystical, metaphysical lore that those who work on the dark side, you know the dark magicians as opposed to the white magicians, and think again, Lord of the Rings. You know, Gandalf versus Saruman, right? So you think, well, OK, what about Karma? You do all these horrible things, you wipe out people, you kill whole planets and worlds. Well, where&rsquo;s the karma there? Where&rsquo;s the retribution? Because. We want life to be in balance. Seldom is it, but that&rsquo;s what we like. So it&rsquo;s said that the dark magicians are able to deflect their karma. It&rsquo;s like they have a a deflector shield around them and they are protected from the bounce back of what they do, what they can also have. Is a group of devotees, apostles, followers, fans who take the hit for them. And usually the people don&rsquo;t know that that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re doing. But you start working for a dark magician. Guess what? Your life starts falling apart. May not be just what you&rsquo;re doing. You&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re getting some of his deflected karma or, you know, she is directly pointing that shield to you. So it it goes off of her and bounces down to the other people. But. Ultimately, there comes a time in the life of a dark magician in their career through the dark side that it just doesn&rsquo;t work anymore. And then all that they have been holding back, whether it&rsquo;s ageing, you know someone who&rsquo;s had the youth spell, whether it&rsquo;s rotting from the inside out, whether it&rsquo;s being slain by the tools that you used to slay other people, it eventually comes back. But that karma deflector. Is a really good story tool.
Craig
So I was trying to think of a good example about that. I reckon one of the best examples is probably The Lion King 1994. You&rsquo;ve got the character of scar, the villain, the serper of the throne, who&rsquo;s been able to manipulate his way all the way into now ruling the Kingdom. But at the end of the movie spoilers. But it it&rsquo;s 94, so I think people have seen it by now. He&rsquo;s betrayed by his own hyena allies at Meat Sea. Dire fate and again, that&rsquo;s that idea of the karma justice, that kind of karma deflector where the hyenas, of course, had been used as the the Allies, the henchman, and then that come up. Since that moment of karmic.
Speaker 5
That&rsquo;s.
Craig
Have a listen. So this is the scene. So we&rsquo;ll see how it plays out. How heavy handed, the karmic retribution. The poetic justice, particularly with the henchman of the hyenas.
Speaker 8
Ohh my friend.
Speaker 7
Friends, I thought he said we were the enemy. Yeah, that&rsquo;s what I heard.
Speaker 8
No, no, let, let, let let me explain. No, you don&rsquo;t understand. No, I didn&rsquo;t mean no. No.
Craig
OK, great. Seeing there from The Lion King. Probably any other one again another Disney example would be that great scene where? In Aladdin, so you&rsquo;ve got the the evil character, Jafar, who&rsquo;s? You know, being able to finally get the genie, but then of course it backfires when he decides to wish to become the genie. And let&rsquo;s see, we&rsquo;ll see how that pans out. We&rsquo;ll have a quick listen to this scene of of karmic justice. How Jafar, the main villain in Aladdin from 92. His quest for ultimate power through villainy finally backfires in this scene, so he&rsquo;s trapped Aladdin, you know, he&rsquo;s become a. Huge snake creature. He&rsquo;s shipped Aladdin here and Aladdin&rsquo;s trying to talk his way out of it. So let&rsquo;s listen to how he uses that karmic. Justice to get some poetic revenge justly deserved on Jafar.
Speaker 8
The genie.
Speaker 7
The Genie, the Genie has more power than you&rsquo;ll ever have. What he gave you your power. He could take it away.
Speaker
What are you doing? Why are you bringing?
Craig
Me into this.
Speaker 7
Face it, Jafar, you&rsquo;re still just second best.
Speaker 8
You&rsquo;re right, his power does exceed my own.
Speaker 1
However.
Example Text
That&rsquo;s no long the boy.
Speaker
Is crazy.
Craig
There&rsquo;s a little punch drunk one too many hit for.
Speaker 7
The snake I make my sandwich. I wish to be.
Speaker
All right.
Craig
Your wish is my command way to go, Al.
Speaker 8
You know it.
Speaker 7
You. Trust me.
Speaker 5
Mind the command.
Speaker 7
Not so fast. Aren&rsquo;t you forgetting something? You wanna be a genie you got. Everything that with it.
Speaker
No.
Speaker 7
The no little cosmic powers.
Speaker
80 bitty living space.
Speaker 7
Hell, you little genius here.
Craig
All right. There we go. Great example there of karmic justice hitting the villain in the third Act, Aladdins 1992, where Jafar gets turned into a genie and doesn&rsquo;t realise that. Ohh, sweet. Poetic justice. It then shackles him into all the rules of being a genie in terms of having to go back. Into the. Lamp. I mean, you know. Storytelling can be a fun way, I guess, of that desire we all have when we face some corporate accountability issue, some political scandal, some environmental neglect that the companies done where we want to see. Some form of justice done against those moments of scandal, some form of consequence from those actions which may, in a way conform to as movies like that portray a comic retribution which could play. Out in real life. Well, that&rsquo;s the media mothership for another week. We&rsquo;ll be back next week with some more explorations into the way media shapes, our understanding of the world around us. Next week, if you&rsquo;ve enjoyed listening to the show, check us out on your podcast provider of choice. You can also see previous episodes on YouTube or Twitch. This has been Craig Norris for another week, signing off. Keep listening now to Edge radio. So as we&rsquo;ll. Have some really cool tunes right now.

Speaker 1
You are about to experience the knowledge and insights of the medium mothership.
Craig
Alright, welcome here to media mothership on Edge radio. 99.3 FM. I&rsquo;m your host Craig Norris, joined by the.
Taylor
Go to.
Craig
Then, well, I think I I thought I&rsquo;d just do. I don&rsquo;t really know what I&rsquo;m talking about tonight, so I thought, you know, I&rsquo;m not really leaning on the doctor part. OK, I&rsquo;m more of the consumer part in terms of, I don&rsquo;t know what. I&rsquo;m talking about tonight. We&rsquo;re we&rsquo;re engaging with movie screen writing and character development, and while I&rsquo;ve never written a film. I have. I have been an extra in a student film. And well, and and an indie film. Yeah, right. The big, big love studio guys. Here in Hobart and I watch a lot of movies and I did study in my undergraduate European cinema at the unit European cinema for a semester needed two cinema study subjects anyway, so I&rsquo;m Craig Norris. I joined my co-host Taylor Taylor. What&rsquo;s your world? What&rsquo;s that world? What&rsquo;s?
Taylor
Up.
Craig
Your background in. Movies.
Taylor
I don&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;ve never been in one. Oh, yeah, I have.
Craig
I mean, you&rsquo;ve acted, at least you&rsquo;ve done theatre acting.
Taylor
Been in one. Yeah, yes, the theatre acting and film acting the Nightingale.
Speaker
Yeah, OK. What was?
Craig
Your role in the Nightingale, Nightingale, of course. As a Tasmanian movie filmed in Tasmania about the convict period to really. Dark heart wrenching emotional journey.
Taylor
Yeah, I was in it. I&rsquo;ve never. Watched it. Really, yeah.
Craig
What was the in the filming that you did? What was?
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
The role you were playing.
Taylor
I was playing Ohh. What is it? Launceston townsfolk?
Craig
Right. So you had. Era appropriate clothing for the.
Taylor
Ohh yeah, I was ninja. I had sideburns which I grew out for six months.
Craig
For the sold really great. Really. Yeah. So you played the role of a British soldier? Yes or yeah, one of and. You were an extra, though, so you were. You weren&rsquo;t. You didn&rsquo;t have any.
Taylor
Speaking roles, not not a speaking role. No, but but it was a credited extra.
Craig
OK.
Taylor
Which is. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m on IMDb, etcetera.
Craig
No kidding, Taylor. IMDb is that the one role at the moment?
Taylor
That appears, yeah, yeah.
Craig
Yeah, we&rsquo;ll have to add a couple of episodes.
Taylor
Of course.
Craig
All right, great. So. In a way, you&rsquo;ve played a type of villain. Would you say that? Identity was from the point of view of some characters, would be seen. As a villain, no. Really. I mean wouldn&rsquo;t, wouldn&rsquo;t, wouldn&rsquo;t there be some characters in that film that would see? The British. Army as villains though.
Taylor
Yeah, but yeah, well, I haven&rsquo;t seen the movie, but I&rsquo;m just guessing from history. There is like so it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s difficult because there&rsquo;s the the main villain played by Sam Claflin, the fellow who plays Finnick in The Hunger Games. He&rsquo;s the main villain and.
Speaker 4
OK.
Craig
Is he British officer?
Speaker
That&rsquo;s.
Taylor
Irish.
Craig
Right. Is this soldier or?
Taylor
Well, sort of like Irish sort of thing. And we basically he gets found out to have molested this sort of slave girl, I guess. And we all just look at him and he&rsquo;s being publicly humiliated through that. So technically against the villain, I guess in a way.
Craig
That was the scene you&rsquo;re in, right? So the scene you&rsquo;re in, you want part of villainous Hanks. OK, OK, well, villain adjacent.
Taylor
Sort of thing. Yeah, yeah. Villains Jason. Well, actually no, for that role I had to. They gave us a pipe and we had. To smoke a pipe.
Craig
How did you smoke a pipe? Do you smoke? No. So how did you do the?
Taylor
Fake smoke. I just like drew it into my cheeks and then puffed it. Out.
Craig
Well, ruining the magic of movies your own media mothership.
Taylor
Oh yeah.
Craig
So indeed, as that little segue to introduce the show has foretold, omnium mothership we look at how the media shapes our world around us and we love these moments of behind the scenes how the sausage is made experiences so not actual smoking, but fake smoking.
Taylor
OK.
Craig
For that scene. We&rsquo;ll be continuing last week&rsquo;s discussion of villains, so we&rsquo;ll unpack a little bit more. What makes a good villain?
Taylor
So just give me a moment I&rsquo;ve forgotten to pay for parking.
Craig
And. That&rsquo;s a villainous act, isn&rsquo;t it? Yeah. You&rsquo;re still in character. I notice. And in your acting, I know you played good guys. You were a detective in an Agatha Christie.
Taylor
It is. Yeah, that was on stage.
Craig
Yeah, on stage. Have you done any stage performances which are villain bees?
Taylor
I&rsquo;m trying to think. Yes, I was murderer too in Macbeth.
Craig
Great. Alright, so that&rsquo;s.
Taylor
I was in. I was in.
Craig
A sword fight that is so fantastic, drawing upon those experiences or that experience. Yeah, we&rsquo;re going to explore your thoughts on what makes some good villains in cinema. Probably you&rsquo;ve not seen most of. The movies, so that&rsquo;s part of. The fun? Yeah, of course, Harry Potter.
Taylor
Is this? I&rsquo;ve seen it.
Craig
You have right so you can as we&rsquo;re talking about this topic. Feel free to SMS US on 0488811707. We&rsquo;re also on YouTube and Twitch. You can post a message on the chat there well in the future in the future, yeah. So all that more. But before we do that, let&rsquo;s cover.
Taylor
Patreon. Of beer.
Craig
Some some news. Oh, that&rsquo;s not cheat.
Taylor
It is tuned. You just played it wrong.
Craig
Alright, really interesting article from Cydia. What&rsquo;s that comic book were you all? The same thing.
Taylor
OK.
Speaker
Yeah.
Craig
Anyway, Superman Toy confirms identity of a mysterious character. Fans have been debating for months. The reason why I quite like this article was it&rsquo;s one of these classic movements with the with the paratext. So you&rsquo;ve got the text, the film, the new Superman movie that&rsquo;s around the corner, and then you got these spin-off properties, right. So the movie poster, the Happy Meal, McDonald&rsquo;s meal thing, games.
Taylor
Game. Is there a thing?
Craig
All that stuff usually comes out with a big movie. And they&rsquo;re referred to as paratext. Or maybe a bit of transmedia, right? It goes to a different format like. In this case, the toy line. And it&rsquo;s one of these wonderful moments where, again, you have the forensic fandom ideas, so fans are out there forensically sorting through content to get the kind of gotcha moment or the reveal moment to get a little bit of cultural capital from their other fans to say, hey, look what I&rsquo;ve discovered. This one is is a toy line, right? And it&rsquo;s happened numerous occasions where the toy line has a bit of publicity leading up to the film, and lo and behold, it reveals a character which had been, you know, rumoured or held off on in the.
Taylor
Trailer. So is it like a character? That&rsquo;s suited up and then you can take the helmet off.
Craig
Or something. I know in the past there&rsquo;s been cases of of that level of reveal in terms of, OK, bringing this character back. Even though the producers had hoped to keep it a secret, so it&rsquo;s a big surprise when you&rsquo;re watching the film. I won&rsquo;t. I won&rsquo;t spoil it for people by going into what this article proclaims.
Taylor
Really. Really. Do you think anyone in Hobart is actually going to be buying one of these?
Craig
The toy line has revealed. Global reach man for Kansas, Kansas listeners in America. OK, but yeah, nevertheless, fun moment where you know, you&rsquo;re kind of big. See where it gets revealed. From a flyer.
Taylor
I mean, this is just great radio, you could. You&rsquo;ve just said that there&rsquo;s this big secret of something and then you haven&rsquo;t revealed anything of it. Wow.
Craig
Kotaku next article from Kotaku. Ubisoft explains.
Taylor
Is there anything from Gizmondo today?
Craig
I got IGN and and anyway OK. Sorry, that&rsquo;s spoiling. Ubisoft explains why you can&rsquo;t kill animals in assassin Creed Shadows. The game.
Taylor
I mean, that&rsquo;s just basic. You should be able. To kill everything in it.
Craig
The game director decides. OK, so why do you why do you think it is that in the latest Assassin&rsquo;s Creed, the one that&rsquo;s set in Japan, the. Game designers made an effort so.
Taylor
Is it something to do with animal spirits? No, no, OK. They just couldn&rsquo;t be bothered to animate it.
Craig
Very practical. The games director cites a lack of predators in Japan and a desire to create a more Zen like open one.
Speaker
Yeah, that&rsquo;s a.
Taylor
Lack of predators in Japan, so you should be able to slice a.
Craig
Rabbit in half predators. Except for humans, the ultimate predator. Or maybe the predator, right? So again, two things there. Zenlike approached the world. So they took a A. And moral, philosophical stance to this film that they want animal lovers to enjoy. This right? No animals been harmed in the creation of this game kind of vibe that that you can&rsquo;t. You know, there&rsquo;s a lot of kittens, right? The screen capture, for instance that they&rsquo;ve got is a kitten.
Taylor
Absolute rubbish.
Craig
The your, your your neck it seems I I agree it seems I mean this game has hasn&rsquo;t creed. Shadow has been bedevilled. That&rsquo;s true by issues around. You know, dealing inappropriately with sensitive topics, for instance shrines also are non damageable and this was based on controversy earlier on where you know I think there&rsquo;s been some incorrect lettering, the strains. You&rsquo;re incorrect anyway, a whole series of issues have before in this in terms of, you know, kind of political economy, a sense that this is politically insensitive or cultural preparation. Anyway, this is the latest one that the game review was saying. They were surprised to find the player can never attack or kill any animals in the games. Virtual recreation of feudal Japan. And they would have pride.
Taylor
That&rsquo;s crazy. I mean, even in the earliest links like Zelda games, you could cut the grass. You could eat a.
Craig
Chicken well, yeah, they say you can. However pet them and draw pictures of them.
Speaker 1
Ohh.
Craig
Unlike so many other open world games, including previous Ubisoft projects, there aren&rsquo;t even any aggressive predators, so I guess.
Taylor
Like bears and.
Craig
Yeah, like in Red Dead Redemption. It&rsquo;s not Ubisoft, but other game open world game spaces like Red Dead Redemption. You&rsquo;ll have, you know, grizzly bears. Wildcats that you know, are predators and will attack you, and so you can battle and kill them. Yeah. This one has taken the view that because the only animals you&rsquo;re going to encounter are are non predator based, right? So cats and stuff.
Taylor
Medic through CNN.
Craig
You&rsquo;re not going to be in a situation where you&rsquo;re forced to survive in that scenario like you&rsquo;re not gonna be encountering. A wolf. Or a bear. I mean, there are wolves and bears in Japan, but nevertheless in the in the locations you&rsquo;re in, I guess the temples and so forth. So yeah. Yeah. They want to send like a bridge.
Speaker 5
Hmm.
Craig
Yeah, yeah. I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s a selling points, if it&rsquo;s taking the moral high ground here. If animal lovers are really going to embrace that.
Taylor
I think it&rsquo;s just. Another nail in the coffin of that.
Craig
Game. Well, on that point, keeping the kind of video game set in Japan, IGN has an article about the the follow up series to what is it the consumer? Right, so this is ghosts of yottaa. So this is the. Next follow on game from Ghosts of Tsushima, which is set during the ****** attempted invasion in Japan. This one is the follow up, so ghost of Yokai director Val&rsquo;s to deliver a respectful representation of Japan on par.
Speaker 5
OK.
Craig
With ghosts of tashina. And again, that&rsquo;s in conversation with the failure of the Assassin&rsquo;s Creed shadows game. To effective to I mean it costs so much backlash. Hmm. So there it&rsquo;s interesting. They&rsquo;re selling point for this game is that, hey, we are the respect for game designers. We&rsquo;re going to take a lot of care to this. So again, a lot of nervousness, a lot of egg shells around the representation of Japan, which is interesting. Even I guess the prominence that period of Japan reached with the Shogun series from last year, which was a huge success. One all these awards. So you can see these game studios jumping into this space to represent it. But yeah, because of the bad publicity around. Incorrectly getting some of the details or being seen as insensitive to the handling of it. I wonder if they&rsquo;re gonna allow you to kill animals in this. Is that a? Are we being kind of? Baby cuddled a bit. You know Nanny state a bit in terms of not seeing the repercussions. I mean, the fact that humans do kill animals and that maybe we should.
Taylor
See you.
Craig
Sense the wrongness. Of that little rightness of that times.
Taylor
I mean in Skyrim for example, I got a mod which allows you to sever the parts of animals if you want. So you can then put the different parts into a pot to cook that particular part.
Craig
And I guess if you&rsquo;re trying to immerse yourself into a reality.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
Well, yeah, I guess I wouldn&rsquo;t do that. And there is this whole thing of what farm to plate in the real world, right? People have lost the idea of where food comes from, if they&rsquo;re just going to willies and seeing mints.
Taylor
Exactly.
Craig
That that we need to bring back that sense of of what the actual reality of it is, is. Has that helped you in terms of your eating habits? Do you now look at food differently?
Taylor
Yeah, yeah, I eat more meat than ever.
Craig
The meat lobby would love. Love you, all right, AIS, Technica.
Taylor
From pork on your.
Craig
Technica the Empire Strikes Back with F bombs AI Darth Vader.
Taylor
Ohh that that&rsquo;s all I wanted to talk about. There was something I I knew there was something I had.
Speaker 1
Yeah.
Taylor
This week and I wanted to talk about it.
Craig
Yeah, it&rsquo;s a big story. We we, Yep. So the subtitle here is Sith happens. This is funny. Brilliant. The Empire strike spec with F bombs AI Darth Vader goes rogue with profanity slurs Fortnite AI voice trained on James Earl Jones spoke curse words and insults before it was patched, so this of course is in a very very popular Fortnite game where you&rsquo;re. Third person well, not shooter. Third person kind of fighter. Incredibly popular. They&rsquo;ve dropped in some Star Wars characters, including Darth Vader that you can encounter. We&rsquo;ll play a clip.
Taylor
Ohh really brilliant. Great idea.
Craig
Ohh, hold on, I haven&rsquo;t. I haven&rsquo;t hooked it up. Well, eventually will. And what was your? How did you come across?
Taylor
This story ohh this was this just appeared in my sort of like news feed because that&rsquo;s what happened. You have a Samsung phone, you just swipe it to the left and it&rsquo;s got all the news that&rsquo;s been tailored specifically for you. And so yeah, I&rsquo;ve watched. I&rsquo;ve watched a couple of the. The videos, and not only did they did it speak curse words and things like that, but it started saying, oh, what did it say? Something along the lines. They always make it so they talk about Hitler and so it said something around Hitler being right, that sort of thing, I think and.
Speaker 5
Right, right, right.
Craig
OK, well I&rsquo;ve. Queued it. I&rsquo;ve kind of cued it up.
Taylor
OK. Yeah.
Speaker
What freaking ******* food is that? Darth Vader? Tell me. Ohh my God.
Speaker 1
Cool down.
Speaker 7
Freaking ******* such vulgarity does not become you, Patty. You inquire about sustenance and yet speak like a common thug.
Speaker 1
What you&rsquo;re not allowed.
Speaker 6
Oh my God. Oh my God.
Craig
So what&rsquo;s that?
Speaker 7
What sustains me?
Speaker
Oh my God, no.
Speaker 7
You. No, no, that is and it&rsquo;s composition it is.
Speaker
You made him swear.
Craig
So what&rsquo;s happening there is a gamer is making the AI Darth Vader swear because they engage in the conversation by swearing to begin with. Yeah. So she says, you know, freaking ****** eating. Food and then the Darth Vader character incorporates that language.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
Those words in their response to make it appear as if you&rsquo;re actually talking to something vaguely realistic. But unfortunately it hadn&rsquo;t been patched at all. They hadn&rsquo;t realised that if people swear that swearing gets incorporated into the answer that Darth Vader replies. So Darth Vader said something like. You know, while he recognises it&rsquo;s inappropriate, like, that&rsquo;s inappropriate, he had made to say this freaking ****** word. But he says freaking ******. So this was the controversy that it was also using the fact that it&rsquo;s James L Jones&rsquo;s voice. Right. So they&rsquo;re trained, they&rsquo;ve got the estates permission.
Speaker
Yeah.
Craig
To allow them to create a language model based on the archive of genes or juice&rsquo;s real voice. Put it in the. Team, of course, part of the conditions since. Yeah, there&rsquo;s I think there&rsquo;s legal action now being taken against them from the estate that they&rsquo;re in breach of the terms and conditions for allowing this to happen. That of course it&rsquo;s brought into some disrespect. James Silver, James&rsquo;s voice.
Speaker
Hmm.
Taylor
That is the tip of the iceberg of the bad things that it said though. I&rsquo;m pretty sure someone asked it to rank skin. Colour. No, they did and it put white as acceptable.
Craig
Really.
Speaker
So.
Taylor
Brown as unacceptable. Black is even more unacceptable. That&rsquo;s the the clip that I saw that they had, which I think is a bit more than swearing.
Craig
Yeah. It&rsquo;s horrible, isn&rsquo;t it? In a way.
Taylor
A bit more harsh when&rsquo;s weary?
Craig
Very villainous, right? So so.
Taylor
Yes, cases in character.
Craig
Also, well, yes, but also, yeah, the kind of reality there is taking advantage of the system, right. So the. These these people that are wanting to corrupt and exploit by performing offensiveness.
Taylor
But from that point it it just shows that it was definitely an AI model that had that did not have the restrictions in place that it needed. And like when they&rsquo;ve had all of these other ones that they&rsquo;ve brought out, there was the one that. Twitter brought out, I think it was called, I think it was called Taylor. Actually, and that within two hours it had started swearing and going through all of this.
Craig
Yeah. I think it was Microsoft&rsquo;s.
Taylor
Yeah, yeah, something like that, yeah.
Craig
Tay, I like how you&rsquo;ve identified with.
Taylor
It. Yeah, I know, because it was in the news. I was like, oh, God, another reason.
Craig
Yeah, yeah. And they basically, yeah, I think it was the the early experiment Microsoft did with AI or language learning models, right? It&rsquo;s not really AI.
Speaker 5
Yeah.
Craig
And then they they put it into the wild, and a lot of people were able similar to this be able to basically groom the AI to become a a foul racist. And the thing was, I guess it was how quickly the corrupting began of that, that AI model.
Speaker
Hmm.
Taylor
But again, it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s just a programme, just put in some things in place to stop it ever getting to that point.
Craig
And it is a sad reflection on humanity in terms of our desire to troll and to corrupt. And.
Taylor
But at the same time, like as a teacher. If you tell a student not to throw something, then all they wanna do is just throw throw it across.
Craig
The room. Maybe this is again another case of this is a reasonably safe space for that type of corruption to occur, right? And it&rsquo;s interesting listening to that clip as well. Part of the fun. Of doing it was, as we heard in the reaction. Oh my God, I don&rsquo;t believe I got defeated to say that it it is fun. I mean, the the appeal of the taboo, the. Appeal of saying naughty words.
Taylor
Or the naboo.
Craig
The Naboo saying the words you&rsquo;re not meant to do, and there&rsquo;s an appeal to that, I mean, I mean a. Lot of. It&rsquo;s there. Well, yeah. I I&rsquo;m thinking of a lot of humour. Is scatological a lot of humour is based on using to to do. I mean, I&rsquo;m not talking about the the racist stuff, it&rsquo;s more the. Kind of like getting into, say, the F. Weird.
Taylor
But can you really glean that much humour from?
Craig
Well, in a way, I mean, I guess, OK, an oppositional reading, right? So dominant reading would be ohh, this is really inappropriate and how bad on these people to exploit the system. A good one is it&rsquo;s also kind of, you know. Mystifying the scariness of a villain character, right, that you can just kind of hack into the system and get this character that&rsquo;s meant to be kind of like, Oh my God, I believe I&rsquo;m battling against Darth Vader and instead you&rsquo;re lampooning him and turning him into a clown, right, that you&rsquo;re kind of.
Taylor
I suppose, yeah.
Craig
Demasculinization your kind of. Removing all of the villainy of this Darth Vader character and instead he&rsquo;s yeah, you&rsquo;re revealing that it&rsquo;s just a bot and the bots dumb and the bot doesn&rsquo;t know what to do. And so you can just get the bot to do something stupid and out of character. And I think that&rsquo;s kind of creative.
Speaker
Hmm.
Craig
As well, I think had this is these aspects to this that are actually clever, right? I mean, figuring out that I mean and obviously you know within parameters you know clever in the initial thing you have this huge company spending all this money and taking all this care and usually there&rsquo;s a huge risk averseness. To you know, carefully making sure all of these are calibrated for the market and they&rsquo;re going to achieve X. Number of dollars. And it&rsquo;s going to be great. And then when it&rsquo;s just an epic fail because of some problem, the scrambling to fix it, you know, how bad can it get? Some of that is is is absurdly comical.
Taylor
Back on OK.
Craig
All right, so next next article? Yeah, another. Classically absurd things. So this is Mr Beast. Mr beast. So he&rsquo;s a incredibly toxic, toxic but very famous and wealthy. YouTube, Mr Beast YouTuber James Donaldson denies wrongdoing over the Mayan ruins video.
Taylor
Oh, that&rsquo;s right.
Craig
Yeah. So it&rsquo;s some YouTube thing is doing and they got access to them. Yeah, that&rsquo;s right. Yeah. They got access to the main pyramids ads. You know, they&rsquo;ve denied any wrongdoing. But after that footage became public, this was that.
Speaker 5
With that.
Taylor
Well, he did. He got the steps or something like that. You&rsquo;re not. Supposed to do that anymore? Yeah.
Craig
Oh, do you know how to pronounce it? Chichen itza. OK. The Mayan ruins in the Yucatan Peninsula, which is considered one of the seven.
Taylor
Yeah. Teaching it so.
Craig
Wonders of the world. Legally, visitors are. Welcome to come to the site, but they&rsquo;re banned from climbing the pyramids or visiting it after nightfall. They appear to have done both, certainly after nightfall, because you know, part of.
Speaker
For the.
Craig
The video is that he says nobody gets to go where we&rsquo;re going. And then he goes there, which suggests that.
Taylor
Paid off the government, probably.
Craig
Yeah, well, this is the I guess this is what this maybe is exposing. So yeah, again it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s an interesting. Again, another one of these epic fails of I guess you know so much money. Just put into this, they would have. They would have to have known this would cause some fallout. I guess they thought either they&rsquo;d they&rsquo;d been able to pay off everyone who needs to get. Paid off and have.
Taylor
Yeah, they thought their star power could carry them. Yeah.
Craig
Well, maybe they just like the publicity, right? I mean.
Taylor
Any publicity is good publicity.
Craig
Yeah, this, this, this, this certainly is brought it to my attention and media motherships, listeners and it was on the ABC News. All right, last story last style story Star Wars Darth Jar Jar. Now available in Fortnite, but fans can&rsquo;t believe you must earn 1,000,000 XP before you can buy him, so it&rsquo;s one of these. Kind of, yeah. And the subtitle Empire Strikes bank. And it&rsquo;s just, I mean, again, it&rsquo;s moral economy question at the other end of that Darth Vader problem, where the fans get to, you know, kind of rewire Darth Vader to show the absurdity of the AI system underpinning it, or the language learning model and defending it. This one is the greed side of it, where the Darth Jar jar. Is a fan favourite character in terms of its bit of fan fiction with Jar Jar Binks the most ridiculed character in the Star Wars pantheon. Fan theory saying that actually he was the mastermind evil villain behind everything as a Sith Lord, so they they&rsquo;d buy into this with Fortnite setting up a nice novel little idea that you can play as the dark version of this, but you have to grind for it. And it&rsquo;s an absurd grind and it&rsquo;s punishing. And it&rsquo;s interesting at what point fans playing a free game. Push back against that mechanic and say no more.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
Really. This is greed. This is exploitative. This is taking something, you know fans want and forcing them to to to buy it at a preposterous price. You know that that price label or that time. Cost linked to it. Value is broken from the fans point of view that you know they&rsquo;re they know this is something fans who. They&rsquo;re charging an extraordinary price. You&rsquo;re getting so upset. Thinking about it. Yeah, that there&rsquo;s an unfairness to it. Right. But I mean, again, how? How effective their complaints can be. You know, who knows?
Taylor
Well, that just reminds me of when it comes to unfairness, greed and corporate iness we&rsquo;ve got the new Switch 2 coming out. In is it 7 days or something like that? It&rsquo;s on June 5th I think.
Speaker 1
And.
Taylor
Mario Kart world, priced at $130.00 or $120.00 or something like that, and it looks like that&rsquo;s going to be the new normal for switch games, and probably PS2, PS, PS2, PS 5 and Xbox Games.
Craig
Yeah. Yes, there was another game where the game developers. That I think it&rsquo;s the latest. Yeah, it&rsquo;s the latest Borderlands game, Borderlands 4. The CEO has said. Because people are baulking at the price of it saying I feel they&rsquo;re listed at 4, but the CEO in response to the $80 being charged for this game is is response was. If you&rsquo;re a real fan, you&rsquo;ll find a way right. Which again, is this moral economy moment, right? What do you do when you get that, let them eat cake moment. From the privileged power holder, right French Revolution. Style that that moral outrage of saying, you know, you just don&rsquo;t get what it&rsquo;s like in the cost of living today, that this $80 charge isn&rsquo;t isn&rsquo;t what this rich person&rsquo;s imagining is, right. If you&rsquo;re a real fan, you&rsquo;ll find a way.
Taylor
No game should be above $100 is what I think.
Craig
Well, I guess this is within that $80.00, but yeah, it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s the response is, yeah, well yes, yes.
Taylor
$80 American.
Speaker 8
Yeah.
Craig
Yeah. So that, that&rsquo;s yeah that that&rsquo;s been considered quite tone deaf, alright.
Speaker
Hmm.
Craig
You&rsquo;re.
Taylor
Talking about tone deaf.
Craig
You&rsquo;re listening to its radio 9.3 FM. Stay clear of the platform. Let&rsquo;s move to the main topic of today, villains, villains. Yep. So as I mentioned last week.
Taylor
Medusa.
Craig
Medusa. Yeah. Yeah. Ursula, you can you can flip those interesting female villains. I mean, I think female villains are alright anyway. Well, they.
Taylor
Jaffa.
Craig
Let&rsquo;s pick it up from where we were last listening, just Disney. So what I want to go into now was a actually it was a Reddit post I came across. There&rsquo;s an interesting Reddit post a few days ago which has its tidal. The question there&rsquo;s moments in a movie where the the Pure Evil 1 dimensional villain gives a speech that recontextualizes them in the most terrifying way imaginable. OK, so it&rsquo;s a speech. Well, I&rsquo;ll play a couple of clips.
Taylor
I can&rsquo;t think of any. The top of my head. Now phanos.
Craig
Yeah, tennis is a great example. Any particular scene from Thanos in particular you think?
Taylor
Yeah. Ohh, where he&rsquo;s talking about bringing balance back, that&rsquo;s what. That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m. Thinking of yes.
Speaker
Yeah.
Craig
Yeah, it&rsquo;s great. See, I&rsquo;ll play clip. OK. Play. Play clip right. Here we go for the perfect balance. So we&rsquo;ll try it. 13 seconds. OK.
Speaker 9
Look. Pretty isn&rsquo;t it? Perfectly balanced, as all things should be.
Craig
All right. So that&rsquo;s the same way he meets Kimo.
Taylor
Ohh that&rsquo;s we&rsquo;ve got the the yeah, the knife.
Craig
Yeah, and and he is. I mean, it&rsquo;s not. I mean it&rsquo;s not necessarily it is recontextualizing them because in that scene we see a certain humanising quality to the villain. And an idea of their ideology.
Speaker
Oh.
Taylor
I&rsquo;m talking about the one where he talks about after he&rsquo;s done his famous snap. Yeah. And then he has the what&rsquo;s it called then? He&rsquo;ll look out upon a perfect world or something like that. Perfect human voice.
Craig
Maybe it&rsquo;s this one.
Speaker 9
OK, brilliant. You could not live with your own failure. Yeah. Where did that bring you? Back to me. You could not live. Where did that bring you?
Taylor
Just playing random bits from Infinity War now.
Speaker 9
To me.
Craig
How? How about Thanos&rsquo;s most powerful scene, OK.
Speaker 9
Congratulations, you&rsquo;re a prophet. On the survivor.
Speaker 1
Who wants to murder trillions?
Speaker 9
With all 6 stones, I could simply snap my fingers. They would all cease to exist. I call that. Mercy.
Speaker
And then what?
Speaker 9
Finally, rest and watch the sunrise in the Grateful Universe. The hardest choices require the strongest one.
Taylor
That&rsquo;s.
Speaker
Did you do it?
Speaker 9
Make it cost. Who wishes?
Craig
It is a. Great scene and that that scene where. He says, you know where. His kind of surrogate daughter up until that point, asks him, you know, what does it cost everything. Yeah, it is. It is a terrifying explanation of what the character is. So yeah, we want to go a little bit into that. The the Reddit post. Yeah. There&rsquo;s a couple of really interesting examples it gives.
Speaker
Hmm.
Craig
But let&rsquo;s first set the scene and have a look at maybe. I don&rsquo;t. Lure of the dark side. Evil characters we root for techniques for creating empathy. Techniques for creating empathy. I think that&rsquo;s the the the one we&rsquo;re looking at here. So jumping into this is the film courage clip techniques for creating empathy for your villainous character. OK. OK, here we go.
Speaker 8
What is the definition of an antihero? An anti hero is someone who becomes evil for sympathetic reasons. This is why we like him. This is Michael Corleone in the Godfather. This is Harvey Dent in in in Dark Knight. We have to have sympathetic reasons to like an antihero.
Speaker 4
There&rsquo;s a whole bunch of techniques and you can see what they. Do.
Craig
Alright, so sympathetic reasons to like a. Antihero. So some of the clips. I came across this one is from the new. UM, invincible. Cartoon series superhero series and then the last season in the last few episodes, they bring this new character. In called conquest. And conquest is this super powerful villain character. It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s, you know, we&rsquo;re talking about kind of evil Superman level and there&rsquo;s this fantastic monologue that Conquest gives, which is similar to this question of at the moment where a character is pure evil, he&rsquo;s demonstrated various evil acts. Of killing innocent people in very gory grizzly way. Is this villain? Who, up until this point with this monologue that we&rsquo;re about to hear, seems to just be pure evil? But then he delivers this monologue, which changes our view of them somewhat, right? Maybe a little more empathy towards that character. So as we heard in that clip, we sometimes want. To create that. Empathy. So let&rsquo;s listen to this one minute clip of Conquests&rsquo;s best monologue from the Invincible anime series. This is season 3.
Speaker 1
I am so lonely. All the other philtre minds are scared of me. No one talks to me. No one wants to be my friend. They think I am unstable. They send me from planet to planet, committing atrocities in their name. And as I get better at it. They fear me more and more. I am a victim of my own success conquest. I don&rsquo;t even get a real name. Only on purpose. I am capable of so much more, and no one sees it. Some days I feel so alone. I could cry, but I don&rsquo;t. I never do, because what would be the point?
Speaker 8
I&rsquo;m going.
Craig
To so that&rsquo;s. Dramatic scene of conquest, delivering this really unexpected monologue about his loneliness. He&rsquo;s so lonely. No one likes me. I have no friends, right? Everyone hates me so much that they&rsquo;ve given me the name conquest. Which is just a purpose. Right. And it&rsquo;s such a dramatic scene. The It&rsquo;s interesting reading the. The quotes some of the the comments underneath it, talking about how dramatic that scene is, if we jump back to the film writing guide just to see how that empathetic moment can work.
Speaker 4
To know what the techniques are. For me, it&rsquo;s like there&rsquo;s three, three things that you do that I that you do is is make us make us feel sorry for that character. So there&rsquo;s little moments where you can you can create a moment in the story where a character is unjustly abused or unjustly mistreated or insulted. Or. Betrayed or neglected. And so it it could be any character. And if that moment is there, you&rsquo;re gonna feel sorry for that character at that moment. Takes an instant. So that&rsquo;s one. If you show that they&rsquo;re like us, if you show their humanity, for example, you show that they care about something other than themselves. That&rsquo;s another technique.
Craig
So I felt. That that&rsquo;s kind of the technique there. They&rsquo;re not. They kind of like conquest. This, this viltrumite alien. Kind of villain character. He&rsquo;s like a he&rsquo;s he feels lonely. Right. He doesn&rsquo;t have any friends, like he&rsquo;s writing a diary entry. The a diary. I feel so lonely today. I have no friends anyway. It&rsquo;s just really, profoundly banal, everyday depressing existential model.
Speaker 10
Ohh my God.
Speaker 4
So there&rsquo;s a moment in the movie A Leon the professional, which is about a a, a hit man, right? And it opens with him doing a hit and he kills people you don&rsquo;t know if he&rsquo;s good or bad, but he goes home and he takes care of a plant. Right. And that right away, you say, oh, well, he cares about the plant, so he&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s OK. The other part is admiration. So this is like any. Any kind of you know, if you&rsquo;re dating somebody or you&rsquo;re trying to find somebody who was a good match for you, there&rsquo;s that list of list of things that you like in a person that&rsquo;s admirable trait. So somebody was funny. Who&rsquo;s responsible, who&rsquo;s courageous. That&rsquo;s a whole list of things you can add to a character to make us say, oh, well, you know, I admire this. Usually they&rsquo;re like, the best at what they do. They like the best. You know the best ad executive or the best agent or the best cop, or. The best driver? They&rsquo;re courageous. There&rsquo;s a whole bunch of them. I have hope. The list. The list is all in.
Craig
So there&rsquo;s three characteristics there. One of the ones that was mentioned in the Reddit list of Moments in where a villainous character delivers a monologue which makes you see them a bit differently, is the scene from the matrix with Agent Smith, right? So this is the scene where. Morpheus has been captured. Agent Smith has been interrogating him. And then in this. Moment he takes off his earpiece so he&rsquo;s no longer connected to the other kind of androids. And delivers this manogue monologue about his.
Taylor
Feelings manogue. Is that what a man?
Craig
Man alot. Gives. Well, here&rsquo;s what a manity gives. So let&rsquo;s. The.
Speaker 5
Going to be honest. With you. I. Hate this place? This. Zoo. Prison. This reality, whatever you want to call it, I can&rsquo;t stand it any longer. It&rsquo;s the smell. If there are such things. I feel saturated by it. They can taste your stink. You&rsquo;re time I do. I fear that I have somehow been infected by it. It&rsquo;s propulsive, isn&rsquo;t it? I must get out of here. I must get free. And in this mind is the key my key.
Speaker 1
I was happy.
Craig
Such a such an interesting scene there that then again, that. Idea of humanising the villain.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
Up until this point, we&rsquo;ve seen him as a kind of robot, kind of mechanical, villainous character, and then this, I must get free. I hate it here. I hate the smell. Very relatable.
Taylor
Mr. Anderson. Do you know who my favourite anti villain is? Yes, I don&rsquo;t. Have a guess.
Craig
Well, some of the the I guess some of the classic anti villains, you got dirty Harry.
Taylor
No. It&rsquo;ll be 1 you don&rsquo;t expect.
Craig
Maybe the first act of Star Wars where it&rsquo;s handsome.
Taylor
Because because they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re not an anti villain. Sorry, anti hero.
Craig
Anti hero. Yeah anti villain would be. I hear it. Yeah. You, you, you finally got around to watching the Godfather.
Taylor
No, no, no. Corleone. It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s an anti hero who is the main character.
Craig
Right, Harry Potter.
Taylor
Michael Douglas in falling down.
Craig
OK. Yeah. OK. Yeah, that&rsquo;s a yeah. So falling down, there&rsquo;s a note is the story of a kind of salary man in America. He loses his job, but then so embarrassed. Yeah. So embarrassed about the loss of his job that he can&rsquo;t tell his wife. And he&rsquo;s still going.
Taylor
Guys on the ranch.
Craig
I mean. You know, dressing up in his suit as if he still got his job and then he has one. Of these. Worst days possible.
Taylor
Yeah, he gets stuck in traffic.
Craig
Right and. It gets stuck in traffic, it gets bad service at a fast food restaurants, gets accosted by some some thugs, and he he just he just flips out and and does this weird wishful. So he&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s kind of villainous in terms of, you know, his. He he can&rsquo;t face up to the truth. He. He&rsquo;s lying. He then does extreme overreactions. Yeah, in these moments, but kind of like, you know, human overreactions, but ones which know, like, he gets a gun at some point, and he&rsquo;s shooting people. He gets a baseball bat at some point, and he&rsquo;s finally.
Taylor
Yeah.
Speaker 5
Yeah.
Craig
Bashing people, you know, it&rsquo;s just it&rsquo;s just disproportionate. Yeah. And also a sense of entitlement that that really these are not big problems. Yeah, that he&rsquo;s facing. But he&rsquo;s blowing them up. Yeah, it&rsquo;s a great role. What? What? Was it about that? You, you. You.
Taylor
Enjoyed. Ohh. It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s really like the movie and I&rsquo;d I&rsquo;d like that disproportionate response to it. And I was so sad when he got shot to death at the end. But.
Craig
Look, it is cause look tip. I mean, you could do a different version of. That movie where? He is redeemed right where it is that kind.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
Of which which? Is why I think the movie is so good that they don&rsquo;t concede that trope of, you know, because basically. You know, it&rsquo;s that kind of, you know what we&rsquo;re seeing today with Trump saying that, you know, Oh my God, the worst person. And the people in the world are these oppressed, alleged, you know, white genocide sufferers in South South Africa, right. It&rsquo;s this kind of, you know, the idea that that a, an identity which has been considered. The the patriarchal privileged norm white male in particular is somehow struggling and so not living a life. Which is meant to be the same, similar in falling down. It takes that hypocrisy or that sense of lack of of any sense of a realistic base of what real suffering might look like. Yeah. Yeah. No, that&rsquo;s. Yeah, that&rsquo;s a great choice. It&rsquo;s an underprivileged. Watched movie. I feel it is.
Taylor
Yes.
Craig
All right. So let&rsquo;s jump in. Where are we? What&rsquo;s the time? 2 minutes left. Alright. So we&rsquo;ll hear a little bit more about the guide. To writing evil characters.
Speaker 4
Book there&rsquo;s all these lists of things you can do, but if you do these three things, and so when I show clips of the of the moment you meet the character and it&rsquo;s usually like a 3 minute scene. You can see all these things being applied in like 3 minutes. There&rsquo;s like, you know, the the opening of WALL-E after he&rsquo;s done with the garbage and he comes to his to his little house. It&rsquo;s a 3 minute scene and it&rsquo;s about 20 of these techniques done. This is how you connect with that character in one scene emotionally. Also show a clip of a of A of an ad, a commercial. It&rsquo;s a one minute. Thing about a lamb.
Craig
So the next one I mean, is this really interesting scene from well, in a way. Yeah. Some people in the chat mentioned this scene in Star Wars as being one which which. Agendas. Humanising of the of the character.
Speaker 7
So you have accepted the truth.
Speaker 4
I&rsquo;ve accepted the truth.
Speaker 11
That you will, once Anakin Skywalker my father.
Speaker 7
That name no longer has any meaning for me.
Speaker 4
It is the name of your true self. You&rsquo;ve only.
Speaker 1
Forgotten? No, there is good.
Speaker 5
The Emperor hasn&rsquo;t driven it from you.
Speaker 9
For me to come.
Speaker 7
Hobby one, once thought as you do.
Speaker 5
I&rsquo;m sorry, Eric. For all.
Speaker 7
Of it, you don&rsquo;t know the power of the dark side. I must obey. I must.
Speaker 5
I will not turn.
Speaker
And you&rsquo;ll be forced.
Speaker 7
To kill if that is with destiny.
Speaker 8
You can&rsquo;t do this.
Speaker 11
I feel the conflict within you. Let go of. Your hate.
Speaker 7
We lose too late.
Speaker 1
My father is truly.
Craig
Different. Alright, so that&rsquo;s the same return of the Jedi defender Luke Skywalker. And again, those moments where Darkseid is delivering those lanes of, you know you don&rsquo;t know the power of the dark side. Not in terms of where you should join me in the dark side, but a true sense of the oppressiveness of that ideology is is under. And that final scene, you know. It&rsquo;s too late for me, son. Is quite alright. Well that. Last clip one, I think that you&rsquo;ll be. Able to respond. To sure. Again, here we have a classic scene. I want to tell you.
Taylor
Voldemort.
Craig
It&rsquo;s not that. One, it&rsquo;s the it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s Gollum. It&rsquo;s something I know you&rsquo;ve got a background in. It&rsquo;s a scene where one of the big villains in this series is delivering a kind of justification for their actions.
Taylor
Let&rsquo;s call.
Craig
Them right and. It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s not necessarily humanising or admiring them, but it is providing us with an insight into, OK, well, they&rsquo;re not just.
Taylor
MHM.
Craig
Doing villainy because yeah, they want to. It&rsquo;s for some other reason.
Speaker 10
Now future errors will be eradicated, defeats will become victories. You will have changed the future of the.
Craig
Universe. So of course this is Doctor Who facing off against. Ross. Yeah, in the classic Tom Baker series. So this is this great kind of face off between the two characters. I&rsquo;m just waiting until it gets to the scene that I want to.
Speaker 6
It&rsquo;s not the machines, it&rsquo;s the.
Craig
Unpack.
Taylor
This is genesis.
Craig
Of the dogs genesis. That&rsquo;s right. Yeah. Genesis Daleks consider one of probably the best episodes in Doctor Who&rsquo;s history. So there&rsquo;s a bit of intellectual sparring between what these Daleks represents.
Speaker 10
With the darlings of the supreme rulers of the universe there. You will have peace. Wars will end. They are the power, not of evil. But of God.
Speaker 6
Davros. If you had created a virus in your laboratory, something contagious and infectious that killed on contact a virus that would destroy all other forms of life. Would you allow its?
Speaker 10
Use. It is an interesting conjecture, only living thing.
Speaker 6
Would you do?
Speaker 4
It.
Speaker 10
The microscopic Organism.
Speaker 9
Reigning supreme.
Speaker 10
Fascinating idea.
Speaker 6
But would you do it?
Speaker 10
Yes.
Speaker 1
Yes.
Speaker 10
To hold in my hand a capsule that contained such power. To know that life and death on such a scale was my choice. To know that the tiny pressure on my son enough to break the glass would end. Everything.
Speaker 1
Yeah.
Speaker 10
I would do it.
Speaker 11
That power would sit me up above the gods and through the darlings. I shall have that power.
Craig
Well, great scene, great scenes. So again, you know, in terms of Dan Ross&rsquo;s villainy, you know, the Doctor asks that question. Of. You know Dave Ross, if in one of your experiments you created the virus accidentally that you discovered that virus could kill every living being, you know, would you decide to destroy that virus or not? And I guess it&rsquo;s a test there of because what&rsquo;s happening in this episode is the doctor is struggling with this. Decision of does he kill the Daleks or not? Like he said, the genesis of the Daleks highly suggest is is the inception point at which the Ducks begin. Doctor is afforded this opportunity to.
Taylor
Yes.
Craig
Wipe him out. To eradicate them at the moment of their. And so this question is kind of testing, is Davros really a bad game, right? Is there any remaining empathy or sense of, you know, if Davros answered, for instance, Gee, you know, yeah. Obviously, if I found that I&rsquo;d accidentally made this virus that kills everyone. Yeah, that&rsquo;s pretty horrible. I don&rsquo;t want to kill everyone. I just want to.
Taylor
I think that&rsquo;s also a turning point of where the Doctor realises that Davros would destroy if he could. And so therefore the right thing to do would be to not.
Craig
Destroy that, Davros ultimately is irredeemable in terms of even a hypothetical question. That&rsquo;s not about creating a master race. Garlic species that are going to bring peace to the world, right? So again, that was just before then, but, you know. Actually, the dogs aren&rsquo;t an instrument for evil. They like Thanos going to bring a sense of of balance and peace around us. We&rsquo;re going to wipe out every other, you know, kind of aggressive species.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
And be left with peace. And yes, the dialects will just happen to be at the top of that space, so again he shifts it by saying OK, we&rsquo;re not talking about dialects anymore, we&rsquo;re talking about a virus, a virus that would even kill every other person here. And even with that, we were revealed the idea that DeVos is wants power. He wants at least to be recognised. Eyes. Like a God at being able to decide who lives and dies. So a very Thanos type God complex in terms of you know that it it&rsquo;s nevertheless an attempt by the script writers to humanise that villain action. Right. Yeah. Why? Would someone want to do this? Why would someone want to create super soldiers?
Taylor
Daleks slash Nazis, which is what it was based on, yeah.
Craig
Yeah, yeah, yeah. And it&rsquo;s such a fantastic unpacking of that, that, that idea. And I guess, yeah. So Davos doesn&rsquo;t shift into being an anti villain. And to hear. The same thing. Anti hero? Yeah, because it&rsquo;s potentially a lot a a kind of sequence of thoughts that could change the character. Yeah, right. Where he goes. Yes, I see now, doctor, the error of my ways right. Clearly there should be cheques and balances. I don&rsquo;t just want to kill everyone, but there&rsquo;s like.
Taylor
No, no. Why yes, now I would use that power.
Craig
One few to decide who lives and dies to be a God. Yeah. So it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s. It&rsquo;s a nice scene. And again the the the rising of the voice. And of course, yeah. Then the doctor decides. You know, he&rsquo;s got to get Davros to kill the Daleks, right? You know, to wipe out Davros and the Daleks. Yeah. Think about that in terms of, if you&rsquo;re finding yourself facing off against a villain, yeah, you know, raising a villain. Is there a moment to humanise them, and does that? Help create a more engaging story if you haven&rsquo;t seen it, do watch falling down. Yeah worth watching and and yeah, that&rsquo;s me meeting mothership for another week. We&rsquo;ll dive into some more unpacking of media around us next week and. Before we sign off, any promotions for the new show, you&rsquo;re setting up Taylor, no?
Taylor
Not yet.
Craig
They&rsquo;re still Facebook, though. DM for Epley.
Taylor
There&rsquo;s still a Facebook at DM for Airplay, but it&rsquo;s not going to be for the next two weeks because I have exams next.
Craig
Week so. Ohh yeah. Wow. We, we you could do an exam themed music show. What music to listen to for exams?
Taylor
Songs to scratch out your eyes too.
Craig
Yeah, alright. Well, that&rsquo;s the media mothership for another week. Keep listening now to some really cool tunes on Edge radio. If you want to find out more about the email, so feel free to jump on the Facebook page for us or the Instagram page. Back episodes are also on YouTube.

<p>How to Write Villainous Characters.</p>



<p>Drawing on Film Courage&rsquo;s guide to creating evil characters, we explore the concept of &ldquo;The Conflict in Every Human Heart&rdquo; and the idea that &ldquo;every person has a breaking point.&rdquo; We will discuss this theme through key movies and TV characters, including Colonel Kurtz from <em>Apocalypse Now</em>, Michael Corleone from <em>The Godfather</em>, Harvey Dent from <em>Batman</em>, Walter White from <em>Breaking Bad</em>, and various characters from the <em>Harry Potter</em> universe.</p>

Yes, you&rsquo;re listening to media mothership now. We&rsquo;re back. Yeah, I&rsquo;ve kind of got everything almost set up here in the studio. This is media mothership. As always, we explore how media can shape our understanding of the world around us. We&rsquo;re streaming on edgeradio.org dot AU as well as YouTube and Twitch. You can find us on YouTube and Twitch. Just search for media mothership. See us in the flesh. On the video. And during the show, if you have any thoughts of your own, feel free to send us a message on the chat. YouTube or Twitch chat or you can SMS us directly in the studio on 0488811707 so. So as I mentioned, we&rsquo;re going to be exploring the idea of writing villains, writing evil villainous characters, seeing how those villainous characters from movies and television can be crafted so well, I&rsquo;ve been enjoying the final episodes. Of the Star Wars series and or, and really relishing the juxtaposition that TV series has between the. The. Evil characters from the empire and the kind of morally ambiguous, I guess at times good characters, and there&rsquo;s quite a lot of kind of comparison between the two characters or the various characters in the in the. In the show that has got me thinking about villains, how best to portray and set up villains. So we&rsquo;re going to start with a discussion from film Courage, the film Courage YouTube site. It&rsquo;s an interesting YouTube site, goes over various.
Speaker 5
Then the sirens get louder.
Craig
This tips and advice for film writing and creating films as well as if you&rsquo;re enjoying films. Some of the analysis of, in this case a guide to writing evil characters. We&rsquo;ll we&rsquo;ll listen to the first set up for it, and then we&rsquo;ll deep dive into some characters I think. Presents similar motifs of effective evil characters and and not so we&rsquo;ll we&rsquo;ll hear the intro. The entry sets up this really interesting character, which we may or may not consider at the point at which we&rsquo;re meeting them is evil. The the character of war. The white from Breaking Bad. So let&rsquo;s first hear this introduction to I think this is the first episode of Breaking Bad where Walter White&rsquo;s character is again at the precipice of. Becoming an evil character.
Speaker 5
Walter takes a gun from his underwear, steps up to the road, points the pistol right at the at the road, and stands there while the siren gets loud and if cold open. That&rsquo;s a great cliffhanger and it&rsquo;s a ticking clock and it doesn&rsquo;t get resolved. And we go to the credits.
Speaker 6
There&rsquo;s a wonderful speech in Apocalypse now, which is based on heart of darkness, Joseph Conrad&rsquo;s novel. And when Martin Sheen is getting his mission to go kill Marlon Brando, Colonel Kurtz, the general who&rsquo;s giving him the mission, says the theme of the story, which is. There is a conflict in every human heart between the light and the dark, between good and evil, and the light does not always win. Sometimes the darkness overcomes what Lincoln called the better angels of our nature. Every man has got a breaking point.
Craig
So that was the script writer Pamela J Smith talking about a scene from the Francis Ford Coppola War movie Apocalypse now, set during the Vietnam War and the really fascinating character of. Portraying Kurt. So this is in act one of Apocalypse now as our protagonist, Captain Willard, played by Martin Sheen, is being sat down by his kind of CIA mind. And his character describing to him this descent of a previously considered heroic character played by Marlon Brando, who seems to have. Become ill. Let&rsquo;s actually listen to that scene from the movie to set in this idea of again how to write a a villain character, an evil character. And the idea here that that Pamela J Smith is presenting is that you you want to be able to have. A breaking point. Where this character or one way of developing the villain character is the breaking point moment where the character. Has is, is. Is broken and becomes evil literally in the scene we just heard there described was Walter White from Breaking Bad. Literally the breaking point for a character to break bad. So here we&rsquo;ll hear from Apocalypse now. That Breaking Bad moment.
Speaker 7
I&rsquo;m good. And you? Does not always triumph sometimes. The dark side overcomes what Lincoln called the better angels of our nature.
Speaker 8
These fools found.
Speaker 7
Every man has got a breaking point. You and I have.
Speaker 9
Ohh Lord.
Craig
Interestingly, this idea of breaking points if you search on YouTube for movies with breaking Point moments, a movie that comes up quite. A bit is the. Shawshank Redemption, and again a character refers to breaking points within. Shawshank redemption. So the symbol we&rsquo;ll hear from now is. Kind of in the third act of the film, where a characters using this phrase, every man has his breaking point. So in the short Shank redemption the we&rsquo;re going to see here is. Is this moment where an individual, even the strongest individual, will reach this moment of of, of despair or hopelessness? Right. So in in, in Apocalypse now for Colonel Kurtz&rsquo;s character. The idea they&rsquo;re trying to grasp get their heads around is is clearly this character has arrived at this breaking point moment. And despair. Hopelessness has driven them over the edge. In this case, in Shawshank Redemption, it&rsquo;s interesting what that sets up. You know, it&rsquo;s not setting up a villain turn a heel turn if we&rsquo;re to use the wrestling parlance, it&rsquo;s not a a movement that&rsquo;s breaking the character of Andy. But nevertheless, we&rsquo;ll hear how this scene gets conveyed with the breaking point moment.
Speaker 9
Ohh Lord.
Speaker 8
What?
Speaker 9
Andy, come down to loading dock today. He asked me for a length of rope bro 6 feet long. You gave it.
Speaker 6
Oh God.
Speaker 7
Remember Brooks hatlen? No.
Speaker 8
And you&rsquo;d never do that.
Speaker 10
Every man has his breaking point.
Speaker 11
Man missing on Tier 2 cell 245 New Friday. Get your *** out here, boy. You hold up the show. Don&rsquo;t make me come down there. I&rsquo;ll thump your skull for you. Damn it, dude friend, you&rsquo;re putting me behind. I gotta schedule the cake. You better be sick or dead in there. I sick you not, you hear me? Ohh my holy God.
Speaker 2
Michael corleones.
Craig
So it&rsquo;s an interesting moment there as we can hear from that scene in the third act, wear red and the other inmates. Are. Are beginning to fear that Andy may. Have lost hope. And that moment that Morgan Freeman&rsquo;s character reads, referring to the breaking point. Moment is that.
Speaker 1
You know.
Craig
Has has Andy lost hope instead actually here that breaking point dialogue is a misdirection to the audience, whereas rather than a moment of of kind of turning to hopelessness and despair, it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s actually overcoming. That&rsquo;s the resilience of the character after that scene. As we just heard a little bit of a teaser there. If we think about that idea, though, and jumping back to the writing guide of Breaking Point Moments. It&rsquo;s interesting to consider those moments where a character. Does have the the character arc is about exploring a breaking point, so one of the best examples of this would be the Godfather and the character of Michael Corleone. Who begins the film initially as a hero? Literally. World War 2 Soldier considered heroic in that first act. He&rsquo;s on a pathway to to marry. He&rsquo;s not part of his family business, which turns out to be part of the Mafia, and he doesn&rsquo;t want anything to do with that. Criminal empire and during the course of the movie, it&rsquo;s fascinating to see as he reaches a breaking point as he turn, he breaks. Bad he becomes an evil character, or at least a morally compromised character by the end, and this transformation, I guess from from a a heroic character into a ruthless mafia boss represents. For many people, a a fantastic Breaking Bad exploration, let&rsquo;s listen to a couple of clips. What I&rsquo;ve created here are some really interesting clips. From a series of YouTube shorts. Where various YouTube movie analysis channels have created short little 1020 second clips of character exploration. The reason why I&rsquo;m doing these YouTube shorts. And they&rsquo;re very AI based in terms of, you know, you can hear that distinctly AI voice that&rsquo;s coming in is that I think it&rsquo;s really setting up, you know, the dominant way of reading these characters if. We understand audience meaning making through Stuart Hall&rsquo;s reception theory. You can see it having 3 aspects, 1 the kind of dominant reading which is the reading the mainstream reading, the reading that you know the the director intended you to get. Is the reading that the audience is kind of matching up to, so a lot of these YouTube shorts are pretty much going to be the dominant reading a lot of AI searches you do will give you more often than not a dominant reading in terms of they&rsquo;ll be looking for something, particularly if the search is not asking for. Or a resistant or a positional reading. It will just give you what it&rsquo;s been able to dredge through from mainstream sources, often trying to avoid a kind of overt controversial position. You know it will take a neutral tone often the AI. Certs so these little AI clips I&rsquo;ll play from various YouTube channels. Exploring character identification are fascinating because of the way to set up a dominant reading. Of the Breaking Bad idea for a character development. There is, of course, as Stuart Hall argues, always negotiated and oppositional readings that audiences can play around with. So it&rsquo;ll be interesting to see whether or not those Breaking Bad ideas that some of these channels suggest are at the core of those characters are not there at all. Or maybe there&rsquo;s a negotiated reading partially in that. Camp but also saying this character also is sympathetic in. Of. You know the Michael Quarry Leone character is a great one in terms of, yes, well, you could say he breaks bad to become an evil mafia kingpin. You could also say, you know, there&rsquo;s a lot of family loyalty and and survival, the ability to survive there, which is a kind of negotiated reading of that character, is not completely morally. Bankrupt and evil, he has good aspects. You know, a survival instinct, a a strong loyalty to family. Or an oppositional reading. But. Let&rsquo;s read. Let&rsquo;s listen to. This Michael Corleone transformation, Part 1 YouTube short from the Channel character chronicles.
Speaker 2
Reluctance to join the family business reveals his inner conflict. See the moment he questions his path.
Speaker 12
When when Johnny was first starting out, he was signed to this personal service contract. Now Johnny is my father&rsquo;s. And my father went to see this band and he offered him $10,000 to let Johnny go. But the band leader said no. The next day, my father went to see him, only this time with Luca Brizzy. And within an hour he signed a release or a certified check of $1000.
Speaker 6
Why do you do that?
Speaker 12
Luca Brazzi held a gun to his head and my father assured him that either his brains or his signature would be. On the contract. That&rsquo;s my family cake. It&rsquo;s not me.
Speaker 13
1.
Craig
See, that&rsquo;s my family key. Not me. Again, act one. Heroic character of Michael Polyone. Played by Al Pacino, the idea that he&rsquo;s actually a a heroic character, not Breaking Bad. That&rsquo;s his family, his family&rsquo;s mafia, right. They&rsquo;ll they&rsquo;ll send a heavy in to threaten the death of of of this poor guy so that they get what they want. So instead here we have this moment of the character transitioning into something else. So let&rsquo;s have a look another YouTube short from the cinema craft here again, unpacking those pivotal scenes which made Michael Corleone. Great. Bad.
Speaker 10
These moments showcase Michael&rsquo;s transformation from reluctant outsider to ruthless Mafia leader shaping the film&rsquo;s tragic arc. Michael introduces Kate to his family but insists he&rsquo;s different.
Speaker 12
That&rsquo;s my family, Kate. It&rsquo;s not me.
Speaker 10
Distancing himself from the mob life. When his father is nearly killed, Michael realises the family&rsquo;s vulnerability, starting his pull into the business.
Speaker 12
I&rsquo;m with you now.
Speaker 10
Michael kills Sollozzo and McCluskey making his first violent move and committing to the family&rsquo;s way in hiding Michael Mary&rsquo;s Appolonia.
Speaker 11
No, no.
Speaker 10
Her murder hardens him and pushes him further into the criminal world. Vito&rsquo;s passing cements Michael is the head of the Corleone family, stepping into his father&rsquo;s shoes. Michael orders the elimination of all rivals during his godson&rsquo;s baptism, sealing his fate as the ruthless godfather.
Speaker 12
Make him an offer you can&rsquo;t refuse.
Speaker 1
Here&rsquo;s a TV.
Craig
So there&rsquo;s a number of steps there that that example of the pivotal scenes that made Michael Corleone evil or the Mafia king around that idea of of a breaking point and the first one, the one. The the death of his his father. And his sense of being brought into the family through killing the corrupt police officer is that that, you know, first kind of breaking point idea of. His, his, his gradually getting pulled into the Mafia so that as we heard in those other clips his he&rsquo;s making offers that the other character cannot refuse. Let&rsquo;s get back to film Courage now and hear some other tips on how to write. An evil character.
Speaker 5
Then the sirens get louder. Walter takes a.
Speaker 6
It&rsquo;s novel, stubborn.
Speaker 14
This came from Cliff Osman. Was my acting coach and he said. He said he had never seen a decent portrayal of Hitler. Because. The the person so vilified by society that no actor had ever played him from a true place. He was always a villain and he said, you know, who didn&rsquo;t think Hitler was a. Hitler. Hitler didn&rsquo;t think he was. A villain at all. Hitler thought he was doing amazing things for this race of people, and he said because of that, you don&rsquo;t get a real, honest portrayal, he said. You cannot. Judge. Your character. In fact, you have to think of yourself as. Your character&rsquo;s attorney. Ohh wow, you have to plead your case. Or the case of the character to the audience. You can&rsquo;t do that if you&rsquo;re judging the character. And I took that with acting. And I also took that into my writing as well. You know, everybody is coming from a place where they think they&rsquo;re doing the right thing.
Speaker 6
Why?
Speaker 14
You know, so. That&rsquo;s. I think that&rsquo;s really important actually when you&rsquo;re developing. Characters. There&rsquo;s a minute you judge character. You&rsquo;ve got a 2 dimensional. Character. You know you&rsquo;ve got a flat. You know, it&rsquo;s like, OK, I know this guy&rsquo;s story. He&rsquo;s the bad guy or he&rsquo;s the good guy.
Speaker 6
Whatever it is, even good characters do bad things and I think.
Speaker 14
Right. And that&rsquo;s the thing, it&rsquo;s that the complexity of life, you know, no one&rsquo;s.
Speaker 3
They&rsquo;re justified for you.
Speaker 14
All bad or all good.
Speaker 10
In order to create a.
Craig
All right. So we&rsquo;ll pick up some ideas there by the actor and script writer Marcus Redmond, particularly his point of when you&rsquo;re writing a villain. Think of yourself as a character&rsquo;s attorney, which is a, you know, a really fascinating way to avoid that mistake. Of just doing A2 dimensional cardboard, cut out villain and instead. Recognise as Marcus Redman says. There&rsquo;s no good versions of Hitler because everyone sees him as A2 dimensional character rather than not let&rsquo;s have a look at the idea of Walter White and the change. He goes through.
Speaker 1
So here&rsquo;s a TV character moment that I think was just brilliant writing. When Walter White gets diagnosed with cancer, he worries over financing his treatment and supporting his family. But when a wealthy friend, having heard the news, offers him a good job, seemingly so. On a plate to save he so desperately needs, Walt just stares back at him, insulted by the very idea that he needs someone&rsquo;s help. So Walt dives into a life of crime, becoming a multimillionaire on a foundation of sin to prove that he is capable until years later, his enemies catch him, beat him, rob him, and leave him for nothing. So defeated Walt calls to turn himself in until he turns on the TV. And sees that same friend giving an interview talking about how little he regards Walter White. And suddenly despite a lifetime having passed, the grizzled Walt is pulled back to. The moment seething at the idea of being looked down on so he gets up, evades the troopers and sets out to correct him. And with just that moment, the show makes overwhelmingly clear that after five seasons of triumphs and losses, that could have helped anyone grow, Walter White remains now, as he has been from the beginning and impressively intelligent man with the fragile ego of a child.
Speaker 3
The explosion kills Rachel, which?
Craig
That was that was the example of of Walter White. There again, a great character in terms of breaking in, breaking a breaking point character where his breaking point as that argument from the reliable narrator channel. Argues. That actually, Walter White&rsquo;s character is breaks bad because. His ego is. So fragile that he he cannot allow his, you know, ego not to be seen as brilliant, which means throughout. And it&rsquo;s an interesting Breaking Bad. Have you seen Breaking Bad?
Taylor
I I haven&rsquo;t seen anything to do with breaking.
Craig
Bad. Well, there&rsquo;s a great moment in this series, right? Characters, very sympathetic at the start. Of course, the character Walter White diagnosed with cancer, decides that he is.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
All of his earnings are not sufficient to take care of his family, but then through a a school student he&rsquo;d taught realises there&rsquo;s a lot of money to be made in drugs, so it&rsquo;s it kind of is going to pursue that pathway. But then a a rich friend of his.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
Who finds out that he&rsquo;s got cancer, says well, why don&rsquo;t you come and work with me? You know, you you won&rsquo;t be asked to do too much, but I can provide for you and make sure your. We set up and his sense of crushed ego just being getting a handout was so significant that that he, that&rsquo;s one breaking point. He reaches right where he decides. No, screw you. I&rsquo;m don&rsquo;t need your hand out. I&rsquo;m better than you.
Taylor
I wanna make a. Legal drug I&rsquo;m gonna make.
Craig
And then throughout, as this channel saying, he increasingly he makes the it&rsquo;s not a a kind of 1 breaking point and then becomes evil. It&rsquo;s a series of breaking points through which he makes morally ambiguous, bad bad behaviours. My co-host Taylor&rsquo;s joined. Hey. Hey. So now one of the other things. And while you&rsquo;re here, actually, we may as well jump into one of the other parts, which is. Good characters sometimes make bad decisions, right? So there&rsquo;s a number of points with it. Marcus Redmond, the script writer there is talking about moments when. Where you know you want to write complicated characters, you want to advocate for your character and be their attorney. And there are moments also where good characters do bad things, right? It&rsquo;s not black and white. You don&rsquo;t want to do just a black and white character. I I got a YouTube short here from the Harry Potter central because I know these are. Films you have seen the characters you do.
Taylor
I know this. Yeah. OK.
Craig
OK, so this is 1/5 of the worst things done by good characters.
Taylor
In Harry Potter.
Craig
In Harry.
Taylor
OK, we&rsquo;ll do.
Craig
Is we&rsquo;ll listen to some of these and we&rsquo;ll discuss whether indeed, these these are kind of breaking point moments, right? These are these are these are moments where. Yeah.
Taylor
Dumbledore. Stumbled or should be #1. You raised Harry Potter like a pig for slaughter.
Speaker 16
Five of the worst things done by good characters #1 Jenny ended up opening up the Chamber of Secrets by complete accident, and Tom used her for her whole first.
Craig
Year at Hogwarts, Jenny opened up.
Taylor
The Chamber of Secrets.
Craig
Chamber of Secrets. What was her motivation for doing?
Taylor
That she was being possessed. That&rsquo;s not.
Speaker
Oh.
Taylor
Really a motivation?
Craig
So her character her.
Taylor
Kaden did something bad, but she was.
Craig
A bad thing? Did a.
Taylor
In control.
Craig
Of it right, it&rsquo;s that that&rsquo;s pretty excusable.
Taylor
Apart, apart from, apart from the fact of that she was talking to Tom Riddle in a book. And shouldn&rsquo;t have been.
Craig
Doing that and there were weaknesses in her character, right? So there were flaws. There was like loneliness or craving. Male attention. Yeah, that that then caused her to make a bad decision. Yeah. It wasn&rsquo;t a Breaking Bad point, right? She didn&rsquo;t become an evil character after.
Taylor
Yeah, yeah.
Craig
That was she.
Taylor
I really do like. I really do like the sort of like the undertones of ginnies talking to the the book though, it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s.
Craig
Because Tom Riddle.
Taylor
It&rsquo;s. Because it&rsquo;s talking in, in, in terms of, like, it&rsquo;s an obvious connection. Between spilling your secrets onto the Internet. That&rsquo;s what rights.
Craig
Yep, a strong, strong metaphor of that. Yeah, yeah. Alright. Well, it&rsquo;s just number two of the, you know, worst things a good character does from Harry.
Speaker
Yeah.
Speaker 16
Potter #2 double doors love for Grindelwald wasn&rsquo;t the bad decision, but that doesn&rsquo;t change the fact that Grindelwald ended up being who he was. #3 I want.
Craig
Alright, hold on.
Taylor
Well, I I couldn&rsquo;t get my brain around that was.
Speaker 17
So.
Craig
Great. What&rsquo;s the character? What&rsquo;s the connection between Grindelwald and Dumbledore? This is fantastic piece, right?
Taylor
I I will be honest, I haven&rsquo;t. Really paid attention to Fantastic Beasts and I haven&rsquo;t even seen the last one of fantastic beasts I didn&rsquo;t like.
Craig
All right, let&rsquo;s. Yeah, that&rsquo;s fine, that&rsquo;s. Fine. All right.
Taylor
The thirsty so much.
Speaker 16
#3 he was #3 all dobbies attempts at saving Harry Potter and Chamber of Secrets were all actually pretty bad decisions, including jinxing them. Number. All right, all right.
Taylor
Who&rsquo;s Dobby, who&rsquo;s dobby?
Craig
Dobby, obviously the one and only they&rsquo;re my favourite character from the whole series.
Taylor
Really.
Craig
He&rsquo;s such a he&rsquo;s. Like JoJo binks? Right. He&rsquo;s like, you know, and that&rsquo;s and JoJo. Binks is an interesting Breaking Bad character. Because JoJo Big&rsquo;s character was so irredeemable in terms of. You know, a kind of childish character that. Kind of devalued the entirety of the Phantom Menace series that fans then said this card would be much more interesting if in. Fact he was a dog was a tough.
Speaker 16
He.
Craig
Yeah, a sith. A Sith character, right said that.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
Yeah, he, he. Broke bad. So many fans say that that, yeah, John, John Banks was. The ultimate puppet Master Sith character that was Breaking Bad through. Dobby does does Dobby make bad decisions?
Taylor
Oh, absolutely.
Craig
And are those breaking point decisions right? Those are those are bad decisions which which cause.
Taylor
Them to go to the dark side. Yeah, no.
Craig
No. OK, well, but what his his decisions do have ramifications. He does die. Thank goodness. Spoiler alert.
Taylor
Something you never managed to do.
Craig
But again, yeah, good characters can do bad things, but in this case dobbies bad things were all you know, how would you characterise the bad things?
Taylor
It was still under like, because he had to hide it from the Malfoy family, who owned him, right? Yeah. And so he had to do it in these sort of surreptitious sort of dangerous ways instead of actually actually coming out and going. Fixed, sorry, fixed fixed.
Craig
Haggard. Alright. Haggard&rsquo;s you know. Let&rsquo;s see what the.
Speaker 16
Grid having Harry and Ron find Aragog might have helped clear his name with them, but they almost ended up getting eaten in.
Craig
The process. So what&rsquo;s the story with Aragog again?
Taylor
Yeah. Follow the spiders. Follow the spiders. No, that&rsquo;s Fang.
Craig
Said the big dog.
Speaker 18
OK, right.
Taylor
Which followed the spiders into the the Forbidden Forest, not the Black Forest that&rsquo;s in Germany, into the Forbidden Forest. And at the end there&rsquo;s a massive spider who tries to feed him, feed them to.
Craig
So.
Taylor
The family. That&rsquo;s why the family.
Craig
Good characters do bad things. In this case. Hagrid, who is you know, kind of a mentor, a kind of custodian to the boys, right? He&rsquo;s.
Taylor
Yeah, yeah.
Craig
The the 1st. Wizarding character the Harry needs really and he&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s he. He very much means well. What was he screw up here? Now is the bad thing.
Taylor
Well, cause he was just about to go to Azkaban right? And and so he needed people to basically know that it wasn&rsquo;t him who had the the creature that was killing everyone, IE the basilisk.
Speaker
Right.
Taylor
And so he sent Harry and Ron into the forest. To me, almost certain peril. Young kind.
Speaker
Cheap.
Craig
Of you know.
Taylor
15 year old.
Craig
50 year old school student.
Taylor
Oh no 12 year olds.
Craig
Yeah, into into a known dangerous place. Yeah, yeah.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
There are no repercussions. Did he lose his joy or he lost?
Taylor
His not really.
Craig
OK. Last one number.
Speaker 16
#5 Harry almost ended up killing Draco Malfoy with Sectumsempra, and luckily Snape was there to.
Speaker
OK.
Speaker 16
Reverse the effects.
Craig
All right, so. So. Harry&rsquo;s bad decisions. Yeah, right.
Taylor
He&rsquo;s reading the half blood Princess potion book and scribbled into the side pages is an unknown spell and it is and it says 4 enemies and so he just decides to use it on Draco Malfoy, his in enemy and always kills.
Craig
Him. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And that the only reason, Malfoy. Lived was because Snape was there.
Taylor
To yeah. To reverse the facts because he invented that.
Craig
Spell. Really. Mind blown. So again, potentially yes, that could have been a breaking point for Harry, right? Actually killing so many people point out that&rsquo;s a that&rsquo;s a moment where a hero often does turn to a more morally complicated or compromised character where the.
Taylor
I mean that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s another thing with the half blood Prince. Like if you watch the movie you have snake there going and he goes I am the half blood Prince and it&rsquo;s like yeah sure. What So what how how are you the half blood Prince and gets rid of all of this entire back story with the back. He is. He&rsquo;s a half blood and his muggle mother, her last name was Prince. And so therefore he was 1/2 blood.
Craig
Alright. Prince, I mean, I mean, snitch character is interesting in terms of a a villain, right? I mean, he very much comes across as the villain. A what? What was the breaking point? Sneep right. It was his left triangle, wasn&rsquo;t it? Between Harry&rsquo;s parents?
Taylor
But that&rsquo;s the point. Snape was never banned.
Craig
And sneads it. Wow. So the reveal comes, but nevertheless, the reason why he&rsquo;s not.
Taylor
But snipe, snipe snipe started off as a bad character. Mm-hmm. And the breaking point to him turning good was the love triangle with his mother, with, not with his mother without his mother.
Craig
Yeah. OK. Yeah, that&rsquo;s interesting, right. So. With his mother. Yeah. Yeah. So in ways, yes. Snape broke good because he&rsquo;s from. Slytherin family and everything, right? His his character is meant to be. Yeah. Evil. Yeah. Right. So yeah. OK, so that&rsquo;s a really interesting counterpoint that that he breaks. Good. All right, next one. We&rsquo;re going to listen to. So going back to that initial idea of moments in where movie character breaks, it reaches a breaking point. Let&rsquo;s listen now to Harvey Dent, Dark Knight, DC comic books, the villain character.
Taylor
Ohh 2 faced isn&rsquo;t it?
Craig
Face 2 face. There we go. So in Dark Knight. Take movie by. Christopher Nolan is going to say Christopher Columbus Christopher Nolan introduces Harvey. Dan very much sets him up as as the white knight, right. He&rsquo;s an idealistic District Attorney, but then he&rsquo;s broken right here. So what breaks this idealistic. Attorney District Attorney, let&rsquo;s listen to WIOR channel for Harvey dense transformation.
Speaker 13
Did you know? In the dark night, Harvey dense transformation into two face after being severely burned on one side of his face mirrors real life cases of individuals undergoing significant physical and psychological changes due to traumatic events. This powerful scene demonstrates how trauma can profoundly alter a person&rsquo;s identity and moral compass. Making it one of the most compelling and realistic portrayals of character transformation in cinema.
Speaker 1
You either die.
Craig
Well, let&rsquo;s see it. Emotional trauma. The emotional trauma, though, is this one.
Speaker 3
The explosion kills Rachel, which leaves Batman devastated since he intended to save her. However, he manages to rescue Harvey before he too is killed in the explosion, but Harvey is left severely disfigured and mentally destroyed by the tragedy.
Speaker
How?
Speaker 13
Did you know in?
Craig
The dark, so that&rsquo;s end of Act 2. What happens is the Joker challenges Batman and. Commissioner Gordon to save Rachel, who&rsquo;s the love interest of Batman and Harvey Dent, right. They&rsquo;re in two different locations. They&rsquo;ve both got bombs that are about to explode and.
Taylor
What&rsquo;s this in the movie?
Craig
Yeah, isn&rsquo;t there? And they&rsquo;ve gotta split up to rescue them. It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a set. Up for the?
Taylor
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, I do remember.
Craig
3rd app, right? So Batman goes to save Rachel and Attorney Commissioner Gordon goes to. Dave. Harvey Dent, but. The Joker has sprung a surprise and Batman was actually going to a Harvey dentist, right? Batman successful, says Harvey Dan, but thought it was Rachel. Commissioner Gordon wasn&rsquo;t successful. Rachel dies anyway, so it&rsquo;s that trauma where where Harvey Dent thinks that, right. It&rsquo;s interesting.
Taylor
Rubbish. Coming to school.
Craig
Again, the idea of Rutrum A is almost click on it.
Speaker 1
You either die a hero. Or you live long enough to see yourself.
Speaker 2
Become the villain.
Speaker 18
Store.
Speaker
Face Gotham&rsquo;s bright future.
Speaker 11
It&rsquo;s about what&rsquo;s.
Craig
Right. Yep. So that&rsquo;s again one of these. Other cliches of. Become the villain. You either die the hero or live long enough to become the villain. Interestingly, I saw that as a meme today where someone posted these frozen meals. That were Gordon Ramsay granted Gordon Ramsay&rsquo;s frozen pasta, Gordon Ramsay&rsquo;s frozen sausages. That yeah, you just put in the microwave to eat. It&rsquo;s like that&rsquo;s that concept. You either, you know, die early as the hero or you live long and become the the villain. So again, the idea there being if Harvey Dent had died in that second act explosion, he would have died.
Speaker 11
OK.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
Hero, right? Everyone would still have remembered him as the heroic. District Attorney. But then he justifies his sense of of revenge by, you know, he&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s he hasn&rsquo;t died, but he&rsquo;s now become the villain. Interesting one here is Jack Torrance&rsquo;s character in the shining.
Speaker
Hmm.
Craig
Not seeing it? Great horror film. Alright, it tells the story of the character Jack Torrance. It&rsquo;s a Stephen King novel based on Stephen King novel. This is a clip from the movie by Stanley Kubrick.
Taylor
I&rsquo;ve seen it.
Craig
Great. Well, there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s one horror film we&rsquo;re not talking about. The Jack Torrance played by Jack Nicholson and it&rsquo;s interesting, this, this, this, the art of narrative YouTube channel is is here presenting his theory on the breaking point for Jack Torrance&rsquo;s character. Why do we go from this character that is. Not crazy to by act too crazy. Crazy.
Speaker 18
Drove Jack Torrance crazy. I think the answer isn&rsquo;t as clear as you might believe. Any fan of the film could recite a combination of factors that contributed to Jack&rsquo;s Madness. The isolation of the Overlook Hotel, located in a remote area that is cut off from the outside world in the bleak white winter, the hotel&rsquo;s dark history of violence, or the ghosts of the former guests and employees who haunt Jack and torment him, bringing out his worst demons. And finally, Jack&rsquo;s own alcoholism and mental instability. All of these factors combined created the perfect storm that drove Jack to madness, but these all missed one important clue. Jack&rsquo;s complete inability to write in the absence of all other distractions, Jack is forced to confront.
Speaker
How&rsquo;s it going?
Speaker 18
The horrifying truth, his utter lack of talent. And that is.
Craig
Lack of talent, right? So the position that the our narrative is presenting is that it&rsquo;s because Jack. Torrance&rsquo;s cart has been deceiving himself. He&rsquo;s actually not a good rider. The whole thing is that he&rsquo;s gone to do the winter caretaker for this hotel, so he has time to write his great novel. As we see in the film, though, you know he doesn&rsquo;t. He&rsquo;s not actually able to write, and he becomes increasingly frustrated by his wife and his child. He turns to alcohol, but the core breaking points concept that this are narratives presenting is that it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s his own self delusion and self deceit. And craving for success, which has which is which has broken him, that he he cannot, he does not understand himself and he does not understand himself that ultimately he&rsquo;s just not a good writer. He&rsquo;s not capable of it. Let&rsquo;s let&rsquo;s have a look at Anakin Skywalker.
Speaker 18
Star Wars? Yep.
Taylor
OK.
Speaker 17
When did Anakin Skywalker fully embrace the dark side? Some believed it happened when he defied the Jedi Order to save Chancellor Palpatine from Mace Windu. Others think it was his rampage on Mustafar where he betrayed the wife he once held dear. The logical time was when he slaughtered younglings in the Jedi Temple. Yet we learn in the rise and fall of Darth Vader. That Anakin still thought of himself as Anakin when Emperor Palpatine crossed the lava shores of Mustafar to his apprentices burned body. It wasn&rsquo;t until he was sealed inside his life support suit and the emperor asked Lord Vader if he could hear him that Darth Vader realised Anakin was God. It was upon learning that his wife and child were dead at his own hands, that Vader lost all hope. His wife was gone forever, leaving him devoid of love. And in that moment he fully surrendered to the dark side.
Craig
Yeah. So I mean there&rsquo;s a number. Of moments in. The film, where the character of Anakin does a number of bad things. Right, killing the younglings. Most people would say, is a moment. Where he he&rsquo;s broke. Right. He&rsquo;s a breaking point.
Taylor
No, that was valid.
Craig
Yeah, well, this is what? This this is what Star Wars apprentice is saying. That&rsquo;s not actually the breaking point, because he still sees himself as Anakin, right? Still redeemable. I guess his argument is it&rsquo;s the moon, which not only is he encased in the life. Support system of the Darth Vader uniform, but he&rsquo;s told by Palpatine that you know his wife is dead as well. In fact, let&rsquo;s listen to that scene.
Speaker
Just help me save at least like.
Speaker 7
I can&rsquo;t live without.
Speaker 8
Where is she and your anger?
Speaker 11
No.
Speaker 7
I couldn&rsquo;t. She was alive. I felt it.
Craig
Ohh alright yeah. So the idea being that yeah, it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s that moment in which. He he thinks he&rsquo;s killed his wife. Well, she does die, actually, after his church forced hold on her. Yeah, so. I I can&rsquo;t, you know, so there there&rsquo;s some interesting thoughts there around writing evil characters. My takeaway actually is the point that. That you&rsquo;ve got to think of yourself as a character&rsquo;s attorney, right? You can&rsquo;t just reduce the character to being. I need a bad guy, so he&rsquo;s just irredeemably bad. Make yourself the characters attorney, understand that every character sees themselves as heroic or the centre of the movie. Or not kind of, you know, kind of non functional evil, right? They they see themselves as justified. Yeah. For the actions they&rsquo;re taking. So that&rsquo;s media mothership for this week. Do we have? Another show after.
Taylor
This no, but I we&rsquo;re. I&rsquo;m going to run some tests to make sure that what I&rsquo;ve got will work so.
Craig
Great. Fascinating. Alright. Well, keep listening then to Edge radio. We&rsquo;ve got some some great tunes coming in. Think about those ideas of breaking point moments and characters right? What movies have you seen, where there&rsquo;s been a breaking point moment? Events that&rsquo;s caused the character to turn evil.

<p>Why do many Star Wars villains have British accents?</p>



<p>In this episode, we break down the significance of this choice using cultural theory and storytelling frameworks. Drawing from John Fiske&rsquo;s Textual Poaching, we explore how audiences interpret and reframe these portrayals. Stuart Hall&rsquo;s theories on representation, identity, and ideology help explain how accent and villainy intersect in mainstream media. Plus, Blake Snyder&rsquo;s Save the Cat framework sheds light on how storytelling conventions reinforce this trope.</p>

We&rsquo;re broadcasting out of Edge Radio studios here in Nepal, Luna, Hobart TAS, and I&rsquo;m your host, Craig Norris. On this show, we explore how media can shape our understanding of the world around us, and we&rsquo;re streaming on edgeradio.org dot AU as well as. Live streaming on YouTube as well as twit.

And today we&rsquo;ve got our live musical. Or kind of accompaniment with the beautiful sounds of the kalimba. There we go live in studio. So let&rsquo;s have a look at some interesting media news pieces that have come up over the last week or two so. Over in Japan, a Japanese actors dramatic Pok&eacute;mon save data loss has gone viral during traumatic memories and sympathy from fellow gainers. This is an article from IGN yesterday. The subtitle is even if save data disappears, the memories remain. Let&rsquo;s listen to a bit of the drama from the Japanese live streamer. So this. Actor Shinya Okada has been doing a video game, YouTube channel, and. He&rsquo;d. He&rsquo;d logged in to his what is it in his latest Let&rsquo;s Play video posted April 29th. Widest cheerful enthusiasm as the article says, to continue his Pok&eacute;mon Red Adventure gradually morphs into disbelief as the game asks him if he wants to start. From the beginning of Whitey&rsquo;s startled reaction of weigh. What as he realises that all the hours he has put into capturing and training Pok&eacute;mon have vanished. Our Pebble. Let&rsquo;s listen to that drama.
Speaker 3

This is from do you ever play the Pok&eacute;mon? Games. Come on mate. I&rsquo;ve had it. I know. Totally thank goodness for that. Yeah.

Then why would they do?
Taylor
That I don&rsquo;t know, but that&rsquo;s why it was. That&rsquo;s why they redid it for the. Game Boy, when they redid it, it was fire red and leaf green and people like, well, why isn&rsquo;t it fire red and water blue? It&rsquo;s like well, because in Japan it was green. It was never blue.
Craig
Mind blown. I mean, I wonder how many comments we&rsquo;re gonna get. From that reaction because he. His his comment that he lost his save game quickly amassed 4.4 million views on the comments, so I&rsquo;m hoping SMS and now anyway so the because he posted that my Pok&eacute;mon Red Game Boy cartridge, so he I guess he was playing on an actual Game Boy. Control system rather than an email. Later, just vanished when he booted it up after X number of millions of hours playing it, and so he goes on seeing my remaining lifetime. I will not find another adventure to embark on. So rather dramatic. Yeah. So, yeah, he&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s unfortunate to have loss experience, attracted many sympathetic comments. People reminiscing about the sadness they&rsquo;ve felt when they&rsquo;ve lost valuable saves their children. Did you ever lose any saves? Particularly, I guess cartridge based systems like a Game Boy and 64 PS1 PS.
Taylor
I don&rsquo;t. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever had a loss like that. A corruption or anything like.
Craig
2 memory card.
Speaker 4
Correct.
Taylor
That I I take care of my thing.
Craig
I recently had that problem. Where.
Taylor
You save Scott.
Craig
Now what happened was, yeah, well, this was the game I&rsquo;ve been save Scumming forever on. And that&rsquo;s right. Yeah. I was using OneDrive to cloud save where the save files were going from Paradox.
Taylor
OK. All right, yeah.
Craig
For the game provider for Crusader Kings 3. And and I for some reason like I&rsquo;ve been using 2 OneDrive accounts and and anyway the the account that had all those saves linked to them wasn&rsquo;t syncing properly. Yeah, and by the time I sorted it. Out it it. Had lost those saves. So yeah, right back to like.
Taylor
And.
Craig
You know, two years ago, when I. Bought a game. So yeah, yeah, it does happen. It does.
Taylor
Happen. Well, actually, when we&rsquo;re talking about old tech, that reminds me of, I think it was around two or three months ago. Nintendo said that they have officially run out of Nintendo 3D.
Speaker
Alright.
Taylor
Yes, like repair kits, right? If you have a 3DS and you break anything on it up until now, up until about three months ago, you could have at least sent it back and they might have fixed it. Or you might have sent it to some sort of store, and that store might have got the parts and fixed it. But now they have. They&rsquo;re not making anymore.
Speaker
6.
Taylor
It&rsquo;s all gone. All of the reserves.
Speaker
See.
Craig
Are gone, you know, right to repair, right, right to repair.
Speaker 5
Yes.
Craig
All right. So the the next story. It&rsquo;s.
Taylor
Really a kalimba?
Craig
They&rsquo;re great. They&rsquo;re thumb piano. Yeah. Do you know how to play the kalimba?
Taylor
No, but I could probably pick it up in 5.
Craig
Then. Minutes alright. Well, you can be in charge. Of playing the. Tunes. Well, we&rsquo;re going from story to story. So OK, next story.
Speaker 7
OK, cool.
Craig
This is from Engadget Star Wars tales. The Star Wars tales of the Underworld will premiere on Fortnite beginning May 2nd, which blows my mind. So this.
Speaker 7
Shouldn&rsquo;t.
Taylor
You may the 4th.
Craig
Well, yeah, actually that that&rsquo;s a great point where the 4th is actually the holiday. Well, the the fake Star Wars holiday, may the fourth be with you. It&rsquo;s a bit of Star Wars news. So this is the new animated Star Wars series. And strangely, the first it&rsquo;s at least Episode 1 is premiering on the game platform. Or Fortnite? Right. So could you imagine going playing for and logging into Fortnite, then taking your character because it says that viewing will take place in the in game location called Star Wars Watch Party Island? You&rsquo;ve gotta go to this island, and then you&rsquo;ll you&rsquo;ll see a screen right on the island like a movie screen. What is? You&rsquo;ve got your character.
Taylor
OK. OK. Yeah. But it&rsquo;s not in game. Well, it is you. No. No, but it&rsquo;s not in a like a.
Craig
Oh, the fighting is switched off.
Taylor
Game, not the fighting switched off because I saw a as a singer. I don&rsquo;t particularly like.
Craig
Hey, please do it. You&rsquo;re in this. K pop.
Taylor
No tones and eye.
Craig
Tones an eye.
Taylor
Yeah. Who did the dance? It&rsquo;s one ohh, right? Yeah. She had a concert in Fortnite. Ohh, and you just basically load up into this screen and sort of like. There are all these visuals. There&rsquo;s like the video of it, and then suddenly you&rsquo;ll be, like transported down some sort of tunnel. And it&rsquo;s like, all with the musics going. And it&rsquo;s like a visualiser sort of effect sort of thing. So it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s still sort of like a a playable experience rather than just watching something.
Craig
And. Wow. And living in the future. Kind of vibe like, OK, so yeah, it&rsquo;d be interesting SMS. And now if you&rsquo;re planning to do it, OK, NEXT story.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
Musical interlude. That&rsquo;s quite good. Fallout creator says he was ordered to destroy source code that the studio has since lost. I had the I had had that in digital form and was ordered to destroy it. So this is a case. This is the file that created Tim Kaine and he was in an interview and he, he said. Yeah, this horrible thing happened and it&rsquo;s happened in, well, in terms of its standard practise, he said. In his experience working with a company where after you finished the job, they&rsquo;ll ask you to destroy all copies of the source code, right? And that they will then be the custodians and librarian guardian, guardian of the source code. Right. So it will be held. In the company, right, rather than the creator creator&rsquo;s hands. So he said this happened a couple of times where he&rsquo;s going to have destroyed everything as required, and then the company has lost it. Right. And he said he found this out because he. It was so this was like, years after he destroyed it. He goes. Where is it? You know? So then he says a few years later, after I had left the company, they contacted me and said, oops, we&rsquo;ve lost it. And I thought at first they were trapping me into into confessing that he&rsquo;d made a a legal error by keeping them. But he said no, no. I destroyed them like he told.
Speaker 7
Yeah.
Craig
And it turned out that they&rsquo;ve really lost them and they were hoping and they were hoping he hadn&rsquo;t done what he was legally required to do anyway. So he&rsquo;s saying, yeah, this is a problem because there are so many games out there in the 70s from the Seventies, 80s and 90s, that that source code is just gone because of mismanagement and.
Taylor
And we&rsquo;re panicking. Yeah. I wish well. Reminds me of Doctor Who. How?
Craig
Like white doctor episodes ago on the BBC, taped over.
Taylor
Fair enough. Yeah, fair enough. But also in terms of. How we&rsquo;re talking about how DS game, how DS has been. The DS NO3DS3DS is the one that has. They&rsquo;ve got no more parts for it. So don&rsquo;t they then have some sort of obligation to let it be emulated or is it just gonna go into the ether?
Speaker 4
What?
Craig
Yes, for prosperity.
Speaker 5
Great point.
Craig
Yeah. Yep. Yep. Well, emulate this SMS in now. Send us a message on the chat if you have, you know, the revolution starts here. Next story. Yep, you&rsquo;re doing well. It&rsquo;s beautiful. George Lucas here in the next story posted on Goose Mondo as well as a couple of other spaces. Anyway, article from.
Taylor
Gizmodo, saying you know The funny thing about that first of all is I&rsquo;ve always looked at that and it says very clearly. Gizmodo, Gizmodo.
Craig
It does too. I know Mondo Mondo is much better modo. Sorry go, Gaius Moto. Their headline is reveals why Yoda talks like that George Lucas does. Nice. Nice to see what they&rsquo;ve done there. The Star Wars creator recently settled a long standing question about the Jedi Master, so let&rsquo;s play the clip that this is part of. So here&rsquo;s George Lucas recently talking at. I think it&rsquo;s like a.
Taylor
Comic Con sort.
Craig
Of thing. It was, yeah, something like that, yeah.
Speaker
Why does Yoda speak backwards?
Speaker 5
Well, I will tell you, thank you. Yoda had a very distinctive way of talking because and it it was done purposely.
Speaker 4
Yeah, it&rsquo;s.
Speaker 5
Because if you were speaking regular English or being was he? People don&rsquo;t listen that much. But if he has an accent or it&rsquo;s really hard to understand what he&rsquo;s saying, they focus on what he&rsquo;s saying.
Speaker 4
Jedi Master Yoda, you seek Yoda.
Speaker
You know him?
Speaker 4
To him, alien.
Speaker 5
And what he was, he was basically the philosopher of the movie. So he was talking about all of the things, you know, in long talking scenes and stuff where I had to figure out a way to get people to actually listen, especially 12 year olds.
Craig
All right, so George Lucas&rsquo;s answer there in terms of why Yoda speaks kind of inverted is, so it will. Force people to listen to what you&rsquo;re saying because it&rsquo;s like what? So it&rsquo;s that kind of slow down and listen effect which what do you what do you think?
Speaker 7
Yeah.
Taylor
But should, but as as a as a movie maker, shouldn&rsquo;t everyone be listening to what your characters are saying all the time? You just make everyone speak like that.
Craig
Well, I mean we. That&rsquo;s great. I like that theory. If this is true. Well, I did. I did ask some leading theory.
Speaker 7
Yeah.
Craig
You know, so let&rsquo;s start with John first. John Fisk is one of my favourite cultural studies theorists. OK, he came up with the concept of cultural economy and textual poaching. So I asked techy PPT to say what John Fisk said about your distinctive speech patterns.
Taylor
Would have.
Craig
OK. So in terms of cultural economy theory, so this is a theory about how media creates hierarchies of meaning and value. Yoda&rsquo;s speech marked by inverted syntax. Immediately sets them apart from other characters, cause I guess no one else speaks in inverted syntax in styles.
Taylor
And 2D2.
Craig
Does who knows what syntax that is right beeps boops the so it immediately sets apart. I guess within the sassing. It&rsquo;s. I guess it could signal wisdom, mysticism, unconventional worldview, right. Because you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re like. Of inverted syntax so unconventional, his speech pattern functions as a form of cultural capital. Possibly right, because it distinguishes him as ancient, enlightened figure whose wisdom transcends conventional language structures.
Speaker
Yeah.
Craig
Right. I mean that or crazy person.
Taylor
Yeah, exactly.
Craig
Right. It goes on to say in the broader cultural economy of Star Wars, Yoda&rsquo;s speech reinforces his outsider status. Which I guess. He is an outsider. He&rsquo;s certainly the only do. Yeah.
Taylor
Little green, pointy eared. Goblin dude.
Craig
There aren&rsquo;t many others, no. He&rsquo;s not part of the dominant linguistic order of the Galaxy, much like how much? Yeah, that&rsquo;s right. Well, I&rsquo;m going to get around to that. Much like, how marginalised groups often develop unique linguistic styles to set them apart. Yeah, like, have you ever encountered any?
Taylor
American English is.
Craig
Unique linguistic styles in your experiences of subcultures bumping into groups of young hooligans. You know, with their own.
Taylor
Yeah. Well, I I guess, I guess what I disagree with there is that usually this sort of in culture, slang etcetera is used with other members of that species, whereas Yoda doesn&rsquo;t speak to anybody else that speaks like.
Craig
That, well, maybe his native tongue is back to France.
Speaker 5
Hmm.
Speaker
Hmm.
Craig
And then when he translates to speak English, he keeps that up.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
In terms of Fisks idea of textual poaching, so that&rsquo;s where, you know you&rsquo;ll parity or you&rsquo;ll you&rsquo;ll adopt bits of a franchise to call you put stickers of Fortnite on your laptop hasn&rsquo;t happened yet. Sexual poaching, right. It&rsquo;s a reinterpreted.
Taylor
Hasn&rsquo;t.
Craig
Each pen has been widely parodied, quoted, and adapted. By. Yeah. So I mean certainly in terms of if you want to do a voice like kind of gravely. Hmm.
Taylor
Brilliant.
Craig
That&rsquo;s pretty good. That was pretty good.
Speaker 7
Yes.
Craig
Voice as well as then talking in inverted syntax.
Taylor
You&rsquo;ve been practising that, haven&rsquo;t you?
Craig
Yeah, yeah, yeah. So yeah, a lot of lot of pop culture significance there. Well, I mean Halley&rsquo;s theory. Me. Yeah, I can keep beating on about this, he says pretty much the same thing. Well, actually, I did another search which was applying Blake Snyder&rsquo;s save the CAP framework to explain what your speech pattern means. And that was interesting because it did pick up moments of.
Taylor
Ohh yeah yeah yeah.
Craig
Where Yoda&rsquo;s mannerisms could be linked to a plot point so.
Speaker
M.
Craig
You know, the first one is the kind of the setup and theme, right? It&rsquo;s the argument there is that you&rsquo;re just speech immediately signals that he is different. So I guess if you&rsquo;re setting up the theme that in Empire Strikes Back, Luke Skywalker escapes from health, he goes to debate a train with the Jedi master doesn&rsquo;t know what Yoda looks like, but. Encounters this green pointy goblin, and because it&rsquo;s talking in inverted syntax, I guess it&rsquo;s setting it&rsquo;s a setup and theme establishment that it&rsquo;s. Different you&rsquo;re encountering difference as to whether or not that&rsquo;s ancient and wise difference. Looks like it doesn&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s the case with the first encounter. It then goes on to talk about the the second. Storytelling beat that can happen is the catalyst and debate beat. So in this way, it&rsquo;s so the catalyst is events that propel a hero into action. So when Luke Skywalker meets Yoda, he initially doubts that the small, strange creature is in fact wise, because he&rsquo;s talking in back, inverted syntax. So it&rsquo;s a catalyst, this moment aligns. With the debate. To Luke Skywalker is debating, you know, surely you&rsquo;re not Yoda. Do I trust Yoda or this green pointy goblin dude? And when the green pointy goblin says he is Yoda? Yeah. Do I trust him because his speech pattern does not seem to be wise. Bad guys close in, right and there to beat 3. This is interesting to me. Snyder&rsquo;s framework emphasises that obstacles should intensify the story as the story progresses. So as the story goes on, you get to act two and three. There should be more and more obstacles and they should be more intense. Yoda speech becomes more cryptic and challenging. It says as Luke struggles with his training, his unconventional syntax forces Luke and the audience to slow down and reflect. And this is what I guess George Lucas is saying about that decision. He wanted the audience to slow down and reflect. It&rsquo;s interesting that this is saying that. In terms of storytelling in universe, maybe what&rsquo;s happening here is Yoda is also getting looped to slow down and reflect by delivering his wisdom in inverted syntax. You reckon if you&rsquo;re a teacher you should invert syntax to help students slow down and reflect on the points you&rsquo;re making.
Speaker 7
This.
Speaker
No.
Taylor
Who&rsquo;s your favourite Star Wars character?
Craig
Ohh denga, he&rsquo;s the one that has toilet paper wrapped around him. He&rsquo;s one of the burning hunters in Empire Strikes Back. He was meant to be a key villain figure with Boba Fett in return to Jedi, but then they dropped that storyline in terms of it then.
Taylor
All right.
Craig
Team. Closing the yard vac with Darth Vader. But yeah, it&rsquo;s, I mean I choose that because it&rsquo;s such a weird, stupid decision. Say Dengar, but I always thought his action figure looked really cool and I was disappointed with how he was used in the movies because he basically is there. In one scene he doesn&rsquo;t say. Anything I don&rsquo;t think he does. Anything. Yeah, you can read my fan fiction. He&rsquo;s your favourite sales.
Taylor
Character. I probably don&rsquo;t have one now, but when? I. Was a kid, Mace Windu.
Craig
Do. Really. Yeah. You&rsquo;re doing the prequels? Yeah. You know, these windows? Cool. You know, Samuel Jackson can&rsquo;t know that. His. Yeah, I mean, he features heavily in a lot of the memes that come out of the Star Wars universe particularly.
Speaker 7
Yeah. But I I I liked him.
Taylor
His pre meme when I was a kid, I liked it because he had a purple lightsaber and.
Craig
Well.
Taylor
That was my favourite colour.
Craig
Was from what I remember, that was deliberately Jackson&rsquo;s choice. He asked for the purple lightsaber as a teacher. I mean, I mean, cause he&rsquo;s a teacher, right? He&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s training other padawans. Does he train? He certainly.
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
Busts anakins balls, right. He&rsquo;s the one that says you can&rsquo;t become a paddle. You can&rsquo;t become a.
Taylor
I wouldn&rsquo;t put it like that, but yeah.
Craig
Master. Yeah, right. Yeah. You know, maybe that tough love that he&rsquo;s doing. Yeah. All right. Well, let&rsquo;s, let&rsquo;s. To answer new story, new story.
Taylor
Thing.
Craig
Oh, that&rsquo;s beautiful. Oh, OK yeah, yeah. No, that that was very helpful. Get them ready, screened to work. OK, so I want to go into Andor now. There&rsquo;s an article on Polygon talking how Andors creator isn&rsquo;t shy, but is inspiration for the Empire in Season 2 and basically it&rsquo;s linking it back to kind of it&rsquo;s Nazi symbology and the idea of a kind of right wing dictatorship. Nazi rise with a kind of nascent rebellion. Now, I don&rsquo;t want to talk about that. I want to talk about. An interesting interview with the three actors that play the the leading Imperial bad guys. So it&rsquo;s Ben Mendelson who plays, you know, one of the big Imperial. Honchos, I think is like the the the second in charge after Darth Vader for.
Taylor
I can&rsquo;t. I can&rsquo;t think of what it looks like.
Craig
You&rsquo;ve got Dennis Gove, who plays that kind of wimpy. Guy and and then the the, the. They&rsquo;re asked in this interview why are Star Wars villains British?
Taylor
OK.
Speaker
Pay attention.
Speaker 8
Now, is there anything you&rsquo;d care to tell me before I waste more of my time figuring out what it is you are up to?
Speaker 4
Near security violation will be brought to the Emperor&rsquo;s personal.
Speaker
Which?
Speaker 3
Of course, you&rsquo;re perfectly placed to answer this because you&rsquo;re respectively American, Australian and Irish, of course. So why is it so extraordinarily fitting that in this Star Wars universe that the really evil people are fitted with British accents?
Speaker 8
The Empire, darling, it just everything sounds a bit more evil when you do it in a very, very strong. English accent.
Craig
Just put it there. What do you think in terms of British accents and everything sounds more evil when you deliver it in an English accent.
Taylor
I like I can, I&rsquo;ve I&rsquo;ve seen that that they&rsquo;ve pretty much done that in a lot of the modern movies, but I kind of disagree. I think there&rsquo;s one more accent that does it a lot better.
Craig
Yeah, that&rsquo;s that. Ohh yeah. Yeah, yeah.
Taylor
South African. They&rsquo;re going back to Indiana Jones, going back to.
Craig
I mean. Yeah. OK. It&rsquo;s interesting that I was recently watching Gladiator too. Yeah, and that maps out like that. All the bad guys are British accents in terms of what Tatcha PTC&rsquo;s John Fisks interpretation of this being and cultural appearance. So again, cultural economy examines how media and cultural products shape or reflect social hierarchies. In Star Wars, the Galactic Empire is portrayed as an authoritarian regime like Nazis. And British accents often signal, well, not Nazis. But they&rsquo;re not against Nazis, but they signal power, control and the leaders. And I guess historically from them as a colonial power, you know, we&rsquo;re talking to the Dutch East India Company, the history of imperial colonialism in the. 17th, 18th and 19th century. So signals power control and elitism. Historically, Hollywood has used British accents to represent sophistication and intelligence, which aligns with the empire&rsquo;s structured, hierarchical nature. This plays into audience expectations. British accents evoke a sense of calculated. Any making the antagonist more imposing. So yes, if you want to short cut or shorthand, you know this is a bad guy. Bruce section well, Ben Mendelson, the Australian actor, offers a really, really I think different approach to this question a little later, but we&rsquo;ll listen to some further answers from the.
Taylor
OK.
Craig
Interview with the actors.
Speaker 8
Turn out the lights. Because I tried to do it in Irish initially when I got the scripts and I rang Tony and I was like this just is not gonna work. They&rsquo;re not gonna have an Irish woman in the empire. I&rsquo;m sorry. We just don&rsquo;t sound evil enough. And then we tried American and it didn&rsquo;t work. So we all fall back on.
Speaker 4
The British and there&rsquo;s a historical reason for it too. Yeah, we&rsquo;re talking about American films and, you know, the villain would be played by the heavyweight actors, and they tended to be. Rich and whatnot. So you had an English, you know, a you had your Vincent prices etcetera, etcetera. The lakes.
Speaker 1
Poems became black stack.
Speaker
The land withered is before a.
Speaker 4
Plague, you know, pushing, etcetera.
Speaker
Etcetera, we will.
Speaker 5
Deal with your rebel friends.
Speaker 4
Yeah. Ian McDiarmid? Yes, the mighty.
Speaker 8
Yeah, the mighty end.
Craig
So put it there. And an actor. What do you think so far? You know that you know, when early in Hollywood, I mean, not that. You are acting in the 19.
Taylor
Ellen. Hollywood. Yeah.
Craig
30s but I thought it was a really interesting point in terms of saying that they&rsquo;re often cast. You know, the villain royal needs a lot of heavy gravitas and hitter, so they&rsquo;ll, they&rsquo;ll cast someone, maybe with theatrical. Training right. Someone that comes from theatre, maybe an old school actor, which is inevitably going to be British. That kind of Shakespearean theatrical training. Yeah. Peter Cushing. I mean, Vincent Price isn&rsquo;t British, but nevertheless, he does affect the British accent and some of the horror.
Taylor
Yeah. Globe theatre. Yeah.
Craig
Films in McDermott anyway. The guy that plays the emperor. Because that theatrical Shakespearean training, do you reckon the villain role does require someone that that has better acting chops?
Taylor
I&rsquo;m not sure like if.
Craig
You&rsquo;ve got a bad actor doing a villain role. It&rsquo;s more likely to fall apart as a movie or an act theatre act than if the hero is a bad actor.
Speaker
Hmm.
Craig
Like does the the villain have to do all the heavy lifting in terms of makes the? You know the feeling can make the good guy look better, but it&rsquo;s hard for the if there&rsquo;s a bad actor as the villain. It&rsquo;s hard for the hero to make that bad actor look better as a villain. I know. I mean, I think like, well, I think like the Robin Hood, Prince of Thieves with that had.
Taylor
That&rsquo;s interesting, isn&rsquo;t it?
Craig
Robin Hood, Prince of Thieves that star it. Was.
Taylor
I mean, I mean all I can think of in terms of like having a big heavyweight as like the villain, the size of the lamb.
Craig
Yeah. Yeah, that&rsquo;s right. With. Oh, yeah, so OK.
Taylor
I can&rsquo;t remember his name.
Craig
1st.
Taylor
OK. Yeah. Prince of thieves. Let&rsquo;s go with that.
Craig
Vincent, because you had Kevin Costner. Hmm. And in fact, we&rsquo;re talking about accents. I was listening recently to a podcast that was saying how, when Kevin Costner first was on stage and performed his English accent because he&rsquo;s playing Robin Hood.
Speaker
Yes.
Craig
The director was so unimpressed with his English accent. Then he said you&rsquo;re just playing it as American. Just you&rsquo;re just playing the role with an American accent. But that was really stolen by Alan Rickman, who played the Sheriff of Nottingham, who really was seen to steal the movie as the villain again.
Speaker 5
Hmm.
Craig
Wonderful British accents. And that that seems to conform to that idea of, you know. You want your Bruce Willis playing off Halloween Rickman in die hard? I don&rsquo;t know. I mean, Alan Rickman&rsquo;s accent and die hard is kind of German English.
Taylor
Sort of thing. Yeah. Yeah. Well, when? When when I was most recently on stage. I didn&rsquo;t play the villain, but I played the comedy. Aspect.
Craig
Of it was Agatha. Yep.
Taylor
Agatha Christie played the comedy aspect of it. What sort of accent did I have? Welsh. Welsh.
Craig
How does it? Where does the Welsh accent go?
Taylor
Seasonal mists and mellow fruitfulness. Close bosom friend of the maturing sun.
Craig
That&rsquo;s perfect. We should do more voices. OK. So Ben Mendelson saying one of the things that made it more likely to have British accents was.
Taylor
Having a a seasoned actor, yeah.
Craig
Heavy headed. Yep. Let&rsquo;s hear how it goes.
Speaker
In time you will call me master.
Speaker 1
At last, we will reveal ourselves to the Jedi. At last we will have.
Speaker 4
Revenge. The Rebel alliance is too well equipped.
Speaker
Yes, my Lord, intensify the forward batteries. I don&rsquo;t want anything.
Speaker 4
To get through, where&rsquo;s my airway?
Speaker 8
It was easy last season to talk about the empires being Oh yeah, we want to be in the empire. It was kind of. There was a little bit of Campari to it anyway. Yeah, this. Season, that&rsquo;s all. Gone. It&rsquo;s really gone. It&rsquo;s not.
Speaker 1
Yeah, yeah.
Speaker
Company work? And then those are finished.
Speaker 8
I think Fiona doing her own accent as Cassian&rsquo;s mother was so inspired. It was so beautiful to have an Irish woman being the leader of that, like the start of his rebellion.
Speaker 7
People are standing up.
Speaker 8
It was. I felt very, very proud, but I&rsquo;m really enjoying, you know, mincing about as a terribly posh English person. What are you doing, Mr. Khan?
Speaker 5
Cassian and or as a murderer and a threat to the empire, I have been trying to.
Speaker 8
Find him and then Genevieve, obviously, is also Irish.
Speaker 9
The public. Although resentencing directive. Is the next step on an all too predictable March toward complete, unchallenged authority?
Craig
I&rsquo;m just reading ahead through some of the TPT props I did. Yeah, it&rsquo;s again going via Blake Snyder&rsquo;s save the cat, which is a kind of writing Bible that people some people use to write scripts for movies, breaking it apart in terms of the. Choice of accents in terms of why villains often have British. Since. He defines some of the reasons in terms of plot narrative, how I was just reading the the catalyst in debate moment. The catalyst is again the event that propels the hero into action in Star Wars. This is often the empires oppressive action again delivered in British accents, the British accented.
Speaker
M.
Craig
Villains create a clear ideological contrast between the empire and the rebellion. Rebellion particularly. I guess if the rebellion are speaking other accents. Like there we. That the fact that the some of the rebellion figures are Irish have have very strong Irish accents that the native Irish tongue or American accents. Snyder says that or that could be mirroring historical conflicts like the American Revolution, where British rule was resisted. So historically, yeah, there&rsquo;ll be moments in American history. Where they fought the British. Mm-hmm. American Revolution. So the British were the bad guys. That. In that struggle of of of independence.
Taylor
I mean that that does make sense like in terms of like historical things like that, but the people like for it to be so ingrained within our culture has to be something different.
Craig
Well, yeah. And I think I think part of it is that that the, the history of British cultural well British economic and cultural imperialism in the 17th, 18th, 19th centuries, you know, the the horrible, horrible history of American. Sorry, American. British imperialism into India or Australia that invasion. You know, it&rsquo;s part of that then also I do like the idea that part of it could also be them hiring, heavy hitting actors, actors that have that gravitas, Shakespearean, theatrically trained actors. So you&rsquo;ve got Alec Guinness, a good guy though, right? But very British accents. So actually it&rsquo;s a counter point to that, but maybe it&rsquo;s the the exception that proves the rule. Did you? Do you have any other feelings around accents in Star Wars the the use of British accents?
Taylor
Not really.
Craig
Yoda accents. No, you can&rsquo;t really. I mean, most Windows accent. Now that&rsquo;s an accent. That&rsquo;s American independence. That&rsquo;s. And particularly because he fights off against the emperor. That&rsquo;s Ian McDermott. I think the actors name is. Who&rsquo;s British and performing in Shakespearean British. Yeah. Yeah. So it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s, it is striking. You know, everything from certainly, you know, the Romans in, in any movie I watched Ben Hur over Easter, Lord of the Romans are theatrical British performance. Right. And they&rsquo;re all, like, chewing up the scenery with.
Taylor
Ohh my ohh.
Craig
The Shakespearean background.
Taylor
Yeah, same with Life of Brian.
Craig
Yes. Yeah. Are there any? Do they do any? Of them not speak. British they Polish English in that.
Taylor
I remember when I was a kid, right. And as a treat the teacher put on Ben Hur to.
Craig
Watch. OK Charlton Heston classic.
Taylor
The full Ben Hur across the whole day.
Craig
Is that 3 hours 3 plus hours?
Taylor
Three plus hours, plus the intermission it.
Craig
It&rsquo;s fantastic.
Taylor
The worst thing I&rsquo;ve ever sat.
Craig
Really. I mean. Ohh yeah yeah. I mean, if you&rsquo;re doing for school, anything&rsquo;s gonna suck. Yeah. I mean, unless there&rsquo;s some sexy scenes in it or something.
Taylor
But it was like a trait sort of thing and it just it went on for.
Craig
Well, yeah. But I mean I I quote it recently again introduced my daughter to it. She hadn&rsquo;t seen it, loved it. But I do.
Speaker 7
So long.
Craig
Think.
Taylor
You know that&rsquo;s a. Lie. Well, we.
Craig
Split it over 2 nights, right? So we, I mean, it really does have two bite sized films in it in terms of the first film, you forget.
Taylor
OK. Yeah. And then the chariot race, which goes on.
Speaker
Well, yeah, yeah.
Craig
Because I mean, the first film has the Climatic Third act of the the galley battle with the was it the Persian? I think first Roman galleys.
Taylor
For.
Craig
And and and that&rsquo;s pretty much where that ends. And then the second film, yeah, then has the huge chariot race, which I yeah, I think really holds up. I mean, sure, singing at school. I mean that&rsquo;s going to that&rsquo;s going to knock a lot of points off of its.
Taylor
Entertainment value. Actually. That reminds me. Do you remember back in? So it was in. I think it was 9 no 2002 between 2002 and 2006. Every DVD had that. You wouldn&rsquo;t steal a handbag, you wouldn&rsquo;t steal a car. Yeah.
Speaker
Oh.
Craig
Ohh yes yes, the anti piracy warning.
Taylor
Anti piracy warning interesting thing came out about that over the week. The this last week the font they used was pirated.
Craig
Alright, yes, it was the font. Let&rsquo;s try and remember it was the music. The font was pirated. Yeah, they didn&rsquo;t get permission. They didn&rsquo;t pay. And it&rsquo;s just this blatant hypocrisy, isn&rsquo;t it? I mean, you know what type of? I mean, I wonder if people that got well, you wouldn&rsquo;t get busted because of that ad, but nevertheless, it it does show you the hypocrisy behind and also the difficulty of navigating.
Speaker 7
Yeah.
Craig
That proprietary environment sometimes, yeah. And a media mothership. That&rsquo;s why we have the wonderful sounds of our kalimba kalimba. Kalimba action here on mother emoji. Yep. So we&rsquo;ll be releasing a CD. Probably by one. Yeah, I&rsquo;m thinking we&rsquo;re getting some great tunes coming in SMS. And now if you have any climber requests. Yeah, I&rsquo;ll do it. Mothership. So. I guess the other thing that I found interesting about that clip we just heard was when the actress the actress saying how proud she felt of hearing her native language, the native dialect, sorry, the the Irish dialect.
Speaker
Right.
Craig
Our accent being spoken in in stalls hand or have you ever felt an overwhelming sense of pride when you&rsquo;ve heard the Australian accents when you burst through in a movie?
Speaker 7
Christ. No. No, it&rsquo;s.
Craig
TV show.
Taylor
Like, it&rsquo;s really jarring every time it happens, isn&rsquo;t it? I mean, yeah.
Craig
Recently encountered A jarring experience.
Taylor
No, because I generally tend to stay away from it.
Craig
It is interesting when the Australian accent is nestled in a whole other, you know, smorgasbord of accents.
Speaker 7
Alright mate, really touches through.
Craig
I often find it plain. Yeah. And and often is quite quite a poor. Poor. Yeah, it doesn&rsquo;t. I mean, in terms of soft power, I guess what we&rsquo;re talking about here is the kind of attraction positiveness someone feels towards an ephemeral thing, like an accent. You know, the British accent has a lot of soft power as we&rsquo;re literally unpacking it here with Star Wars. We&rsquo;re saying, you know, why is British accent used for all these kind of reasons around villainry and power and menace that could convey authoritarian control. Right. That&rsquo;s a huge amount of soft power. It&rsquo;s not them physically being aggressive or sounding. You know, angry or powerful, but it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s just the power of the accent. The Australian accents. Yeah. Yeah. When, like, you got crocodile Dundee, crocodile hunter. So you might see that accent comes up as well. Yeah, a parody of that kind of Aussie, you know, outdoor.
Taylor
All Aussie adventures.
Craig
Rural, you know Bush kite, right? But that we&rsquo;ve been stuck with that since. Forever, right? It really is not at all part of the cultural imagining today. And you&rsquo;ve got various Australian actors, you know, Russell Crowe, thinking of Gladiator Ben Mendelson himself. We just heard from them, but they rarely, it seems, give a Hollywood movie performance in their. Stray and. Tonne.
Taylor
Oh yeah. I mean, that was his name, Thor. Fellow.
Craig
Chris Hemsworth. Yeah, yeah. Didn&rsquo;t perform Thor via Australian accent. Performed it via British accent, you know. Yeah.
Taylor
No British. Yeah, well.
Craig
Are there any superheroes that have us?
Taylor
Back onto Irish accents.
Craig
Yeah.
Taylor
Do you have like can you name an Irish movie?
Craig
I well, there&rsquo;s a really abominable well, not abominable, one of Sean Connery&rsquo;s first films is I feel it was cool, but it was it was it, he, he. He played an Irishman in, you know, 1920s island.
Taylor
OK. Yeah.
Craig
Yeah, well, an Irish film, yeah.
Taylor
I&rsquo;ve got one that you might like. OK, with your extensive experience in horror, genre comedy, sort of space grabbers.
Craig
Oh, let&rsquo;s do it. OK, grabbers. I&rsquo;ve not heard.
Taylor
Of it, it&rsquo;s an Irish made film, Irish starred film and it&rsquo;s all about. These. Creatures that. Are coming up from the sea and like birthing eggs on the beach and these eggs hatch and they start killing everybody, and then they figure out that the only way to.
Craig
Oh wow.
Taylor
Sort of be saved is to get blackout drunk and then when the creature tries to eat them, it gets poisoned by the.
Craig
Alcohol. Ohh. Really? Yeah. So this is the trailer. Very spooky sound effects. This came out in 20. 12. So he&rsquo;s been grabbed then?
Speaker
There&rsquo;s always a quiet places where the mad **** happens. For their pilot whales. They died at sea. Can&rsquo;t be self a sea monster.
Speaker 4
This is something totally different, something something alien.
Taylor
You don&rsquo;t believe me?
Speaker
None of this. Yes.
Speaker 7
Christ, it&rsquo;s a nice.
Speaker
Evil incidences.
Speaker 8
Alrighty.
Speaker 4
You are so lucky, she.
Speaker 1
Didn&rsquo;t kill you. You were drunk.
Speaker 4
If we taint our blood with booze with poisonous sweets.
Speaker 5
It&rsquo;s extraordinary.
Speaker 4
Stay out of the rain and we drink.
Speaker
You&rsquo;re throwing a party. It&rsquo;s a welcome party for. Me. You&rsquo;re leaving in a fortnight.
Speaker 8
Just a goodbye party. Whatever.
Speaker
She&rsquo;s right at. The door. There&rsquo;s none. Have you got some tags? On you not on me, no.
Craig
It does remind me a bit of, you know, the real world phenomena of where you find something you think is actually bad for you is good for you. So, right. So like, you know, bit of red wine actually some of that each week is good for you. Coffee, you know, doesn&rsquo;t that have wow and this week?
Taylor
Yeah.
Craig
Be good for you. So it does. I think it does play into that as well as what a delightful idea. Grandmas came out in 2012. How did you?
Taylor
Come across that so the way that I came across that is so the police officer, the female police officer that you see in. There.
Craig
Yeah, and wonderful Irish accents.
Taylor
Yes. Ohh, I forgot what her name is, but she&rsquo;s in the Doctor Who audios where she plays Molly O&rsquo;Sullivan and so.
Craig
Ah. Is that a companion or?
Taylor
For one particular audio adventure.
Craig
Right.
Taylor
Which doctor? What is it 9? No 8th Doctor Who? The movie.
Craig
Ohh really Paul Mcgahan, the forgotten doctor? Yeah, right. Oh, fascinating.
Taylor
Yeah. But not in the audio. World he is the style of.
Craig
Ohh totally yeah yeah. Audio, precisely. Such a fascinating little.
Taylor
World.
Craig
You know, transmedia movement of fandom there that the audio adventures is where his. Can cause he performs it sure right. I mean it&rsquo;s. Wow, I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;re going to be asked.
Speaker
To.
Craig
To do that. Wonderful. Alright well. So anyway, so that&rsquo;s how you came across it. You then did a search of the.
Taylor
Yeah, because because I I was like trying to figure out who this woman was. And oh, she&rsquo;s in a movie. So it was the first movie I bought on. ITunes actually was that.
Craig
Movie. Oh, really? Wow. Wow. I&rsquo;m glad you didn&rsquo;t, you know, just steal a handbag. Yeah. All right. Well, orphant orphant, thanks for listening.
