Craig
Yes, hello and welcome here to Edge Radio 99.3 FM. This is media mothership broadcasting out of Edge Radio Studios in Nepal, Luna, Hobart TAS I.
Taylor
Like how you say it like Edge radio studios like, that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s called. It&rsquo;s not. It&rsquo;s just edge radio.
Craig
Edge. Well, the thing about saying it&rsquo;s Edge Radio Studios makes it appear as if it&rsquo;s part of a media. Workshop like like the studios we&rsquo;re in. Studio A.
Taylor
Yeah, I know. Yeah, exactly.
Craig
In Edge radio complex. And we&rsquo;re exploring on media mothership as always how media shapes our understanding of the world around us. How gets it to kind of explain places we&rsquo;ve never been to. So if you&rsquo;ve only ever watched Japanese cartoons, you have, you might have a really.
Phoebe
Like.
Craig
Skewed vision of what Japan might be like. Yeah. So tonight, today&rsquo;s episode, we&rsquo;re gonna be jumping into that idea of how media particularly portrays Asia.
Speaker 7
Yep.
Craig
Before we go there, though, as always, we&rsquo;re streaming on edgeradio.org dot AU as well as on YouTube and Twitch. You can find us just by searching media mothership as well as we&rsquo;re on the DAB.
Taylor
You always say that, and no one outside of radio knows what a.
Speaker 2
Right.
Craig
Dab is if you&rsquo;re on the dab, the digital audio broadcasting system.
Taylor
If you&rsquo;re on the Deb, you don&rsquo;t know what the.
Craig
Deb is message us on SMS, yeah, directly into the studio.
Taylor
048881170.
Craig
Seven and one of our programme team members will get your message and pass it on to us, yeah. I&rsquo;m your host doctor Craig.
Taylor
Oh, we&rsquo;re going.
Craig
For the doctor, now HD, joined by Lord yes, Taylor Liston Ma, Ma Ma. So it&rsquo;s like Doctor Who. I&rsquo;m doctor. Who? You&rsquo;re the master.
Taylor
Yeah. Oh, I&rsquo;m happy with. That yes.
Craig
You&rsquo;ve been interesting iteration of.
Speaker 7
That. Thank you.
Craig
Today&rsquo;s topic. We&rsquo;re also joined by our guest Phoebe. Hey, Phoebe.
Phoebe
Hi, Craig.
Craig
Excellent. So Phoebe&rsquo;s here as a kind of litmus paper test because as we. Said. It&rsquo;s paper test. Well, just to help us stay on topic, because we&rsquo;re talking about the representation of Asia. Yeah. So she&rsquo;s going to flag us when we ourselves are committing Orientalist troops. Yeah. In our.
Taylor
When we get problematic, which?
Craig
Is pretty much going to start now.
Taylor
Yeah. So starting now.
Craig
The direction I wanted to take the show in because both of us have found that we&rsquo;re enjoying Cyberpunk 2077. Yes, so it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a video game. It&rsquo;s been out for four or five years now. I&rsquo;ve only just picked it up. It&rsquo;s set in a future. Earth in the year 2077, it&rsquo;s part of a bigger, you know franchise in. Called Cyberpunk, right, it started off as a role playing game. Of course. Before then you had Gibson&rsquo;s book, Neuromancer and so forth. But this vision of 2077 is very much a western view of a failed state environment where big mega. Companies now rural and everyone&rsquo;s getting implants and becoming half.
Taylor
Cyborgs. Yeah, yeah. The thing that it reminds me a lot of big Hero 6, actually.
Craig
Like the animated series, right, the animated movie.
Taylor
Yeah, like where they&rsquo;ve got, they&rsquo;ve got the mixture between. I can&rsquo;t remember, it&rsquo;s called something new Tokyo or something. That, yeah, mixture of Western and eastern sort of things.
Speaker 8
Yeah.
Craig
Yeah, and and it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s really interested me, the view of Asia that&rsquo;s coming out of that game and we&rsquo;ll talk about that next week, yeah. But this week what I wanted to do.
Taylor
Yeah, yeah.
Craig
Was think about.
Speaker 7
What? It&rsquo;s boring, yeah.
Taylor
Something more boots.
Craig
What are the roots? What&rsquo;s the history of that? Sync and as you know on this show we do a lot of deep dives into classic Golden Age radio. You&rsquo;re about to say.
Taylor
Something though? Or that&rsquo;s I was just going to riff on the fact that it&rsquo;s not.
Craig
A golden age, but sure. So what we&rsquo;re going to do is I thought I&rsquo;d try to find a classic radio drama which is in conversation with Asia. All right, so I found what many people were God as one of the legendary radio dramas from the 30s and 40s, which. Is the shadow. So many people might not be familiar with. The shadow but. It really was an immensely popular. Show and then became a magazine and a comic book series movie played with Alec Baldwin in the early 90s. Something some people saw. Many people see the shadow as a precursor to Batman. He shares many similarities. He&rsquo;s a kind of stealth based hero. Vigilante justice he gets trained in the Orient to 1st develop his skills and he comes back with this kind of, you know, not necessarily for the shadow mixed martial arts vibe, but this kind of mystical.
Taylor
OK. Training like Johnny.
Craig
English oh, is that the character that&rsquo;s played by? I mean, I consider that&rsquo;s a deep cut, yeah.
Taylor
Rowan Atkinson. Yeah, yeah. Johnny English reborn. He goes to, looks like somewhere in Nepal and trains with the monks there. Yeah.
Craig
It&rsquo;s that troop. It&rsquo;s that truck we&rsquo;re looking.
Taylor
You remember that?
Craig
So it is that. True of the Westerner, particularly the West. Man going to Asia, getting trained up in some kind of skills.
Taylor
Like Doctor Strange.
Craig
Doctor Strange? Yeah. I mean, it&rsquo;s full of these conventions and the shadows considered one of the earliest example examples of that trope of the person going to Asia being trained up and coming back with this mysterious Asian power. So we&rsquo;re going to break that. Apart a bit. And and have a look at at what&rsquo;s it doing through a specific episode. Would called the temple bells of Naban, which is the 5th episode Naban. Before we do that, I&rsquo;ve collected a couple of audio pieces which kind of unpack. Why the shadow is interesting to to look at just for those that maybe have never had the pleasure of listening to the shadow series. It first aired in 1937 and it went all the way through to 1954, so it&rsquo;s an incredibly long running series. It had a number of lead actors that took the role of the shadow, probably the most well known 1 is awesome. Welles played that role really early on in his career before he did Citizen Kane, which many people regard as the. Perfect movie, the best movie. We ever meet anyway, before he got to that height, he appeared as the shadow, very much to entrench himself in the American popular imagination, because the shadow was just so huge as a figure. So it&rsquo;s a mystery crime, a little bit supernatural series, although the shadow character himself. Always explains his skills as being rational, even though they sound like an invisibility skill, because the main thing the shadow is.
Speaker 7
OK.
Craig
What to do is not only crime fights as a vigilante, but he has this power to cloud men&rsquo;s minds, which means they just don&rsquo;t see him right. And he has this big black trench coat and a red scarf and this huge Black Hat.
Taylor
So how? How does he rationally explain?
Craig
That well, this is we&rsquo;ll hear this, this episode we&rsquo;re about to hear, or here halfway through the episode is a origin story, and it&rsquo;s all through this Asian trading that he attained. What many people know of the shadow is the opening spiel.
Speaker 9
OK, OK.
Craig
That he does. Or the narrator does which says you know, who knows what evil works in the hearts of men? The shadow knows, and I call after and.
Taylor
It was wait. So so I&rsquo;ve I&rsquo;ve had like at the start of some sort of song. I think it was. There was a there&rsquo;s like a. Oh no, it was at the start of a movie where they say if there is evil in this world, it lurks within the hearts of man. Isn&rsquo;t that?
Craig
OK. Yeah. Could have come from. I mean again, this is considered. This was the the slogan which launched the Shadow. In fact, that slogan used to appear on the A kind of compilation compilation. Radio drama series that he did. It became so well known that then it spun off to his own show, the shadow. So it&rsquo;s very much considered the the kind of slogan that launched the shadow into the popular imagining of America. He has a loyal companion, Margaret Lane. Lane, right. So kind of sidekick female character. And yeah, the shadow basically takes on gangsters mad scientists. You know, all typical pulp villain.
Taylor
OK. Yeah and.
Craig
Antagonists. So he has powers of hypnosis, invisibility.
Taylor
Well, how does he? How does he explain? That away, then?
Craig
Well, he says it&rsquo;s just his skill of being able to throw his voice. So he has this ability through his voice. He does have a ring, right. And as part of his kind of.
Speaker 2
OK.
Craig
Costume. He has this ring, which is meant to have some some kind of power, but again the idea here is that, as this Orientalist 5 sets up, he&rsquo;s also a kind of, you know, rational Westerner engaging with a mysterious Asian right. So he got these skills. Mysterious Asia, but as a rational Westerner, he&rsquo;s able to perfect them through his rationalism. OK, yeah, so it&rsquo;s very much that kind of Orientalist hope. So we&rsquo;ll break down some of these type of Orientalist narratives in this famous, you know, crime, pulp hero, drama series. The shadow shadow. Well we go. Let&rsquo;s say let&rsquo;s have. So we. So we have a little musical include. Yeah. V you&rsquo;re on music duty today.
Taylor
That&rsquo;s fantastic. Well, that&rsquo;s so much better than what?
Craig
Thank you. You&rsquo;ve done in the best, most talented music we&rsquo;ve played on that it&rsquo;s amazing what that thing&rsquo;s capable of.
Speaker 7
Wow. Wow.
Craig
Gee, OK, so all right, so I want to show play a short excerpt from a radio drama documentary that covers the history of a famous radio drama Guy ***** Brown.
Taylor
Just go to bed.
Craig
In episode 4. They talk about the impact. Of the shadow. So oops, sorry. Hold on, let.
Speaker 7
Me just queue.
Taylor
It up. You can&rsquo;t do this on.
Speaker 11
Oh.
Craig
Air no build suspense. Just make the shadow.
Taylor
OK. Ohh God. OK, here we go.
Speaker 9
On a night like this, then?
Speaker 3
No Washington assignment for me, no ridiculous detecting for you.
Speaker 4
I love it.
Craig
It&rsquo;s a great harm.
Taylor
And organ. Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 12
And of course, the shadow the show my mother starred in, it was adapted from a series of Pope novels written by Walter Gibson in the storyline wealthy Playboy Lamont Cranston has travelled to the mysterious E old Time radio, was filled with cringe, making tropes like this. There he encounters a Mystic who teaches him.
Speaker 10
The hypnotic power to cloud men&rsquo;s minds, so they cannot seem.
Speaker 12
This is useful if you decide to set up as a crime. Fighter. The shadow reveals himself to lowlifes with a menacing laugh.
Speaker 8
Oh, no. What evil lurks in the hearts of men? The shadow knows.
Speaker 12
The show had a number of false starts with different actors, but established itself with the casting of Orson Welles as the main character. Cranston and his mind penetrating older ego. My mother&rsquo;s role have I made mention of this before? Was the lovely Margot Lane, the attractive confidante of the Playboy?
Speaker 9
The three men you tell me.
Speaker 8
About they look like gangsters, alright?
Speaker 13
Yes, ma&rsquo;am. Yeah. And usually in mortal enemies, but tonight it looks very much as if they&rsquo;re banding together.
Speaker 8
I wonder why of you then why you come here and expose yourself?
Speaker 13
And mad because they&rsquo;re afraid of memes. They&rsquo;re only afraid of me as the shadow I do not know. Lamont Cranston. Oh, who? Who are they?
Speaker 12
Mum knew Wells already. They both toured with the successful production of the Barretts of Wimpole St They were buddies, they were friends. She thought highly of him and also sort of giggled at him a lot because she thought he was very full of himself. But Mum wasn&rsquo;t the first Margot Lane, although the character was.
Craig
All right, so. As that sets up it&rsquo;s character based in Pulp Fiction, it became immensely popular. There was a documentary series done on the shadow. And we&rsquo;ll listen to some excerpts from here as the cast and key production talent of the shadow kind of breakdown. What the series did that made it so influential. Ohh, just cute. Oh, going too far. Hold.
Speaker 14
On that succeeded in the media of the imagination.
Craig
It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s tricky with this.
Speaker 14
He was.
Speaker 7
Small little mobile phone to *** ****. Alright, hang on.
Speaker 14
The shadow. Is from Maine to California. The shadow endures today as the dominant symbol of mystery drama during radios Golden Age in the 30s, forties and early 1950s.
Speaker 15
Two years ago, I was in the hospital for an operation. And the resident Doctor Young resident came running up to my. Room to meet me. Because he he knew that I had been associated with the shadow which everybody knows. I mean, they may not have heard anything else about. But radio, but everybody knows the shadow.
Speaker 9
It could never have succeeded in television. It it, it was the marvellous thing of what what people conjured up in their minds, and then they could see the shadow, and they could see Margot and so forth. I think it would have been a terribly dull television programme.
Speaker 14
What creative forces moulded the shadows? Tremendous popularity. Why, after nearly 60 years, is the programme not only remembered fondly but still being aired on many radio stations across the nation? Who were the people that shaped the character&rsquo;s success? We&rsquo;ll take an in-depth look.
Craig
So they&rsquo;ll breakdown then what the key aspects of the shadow are, but what I want to jump to, there&rsquo;s a really there&rsquo;s a couple of really interesting parts of the whole document goes about now and we&rsquo;ll put the link to it in the show notes. There&rsquo;s a couple of aspects to it, which is really fascinating. Here&rsquo;s 1 little clip. About the the struggle of doing radio because it sounds so corny. When you listen back to it, particularly today. So of course we mainly engage with storytelling through movies and TV. One of the trouble, one of the difficulties, one of the challenges of doing audio only storytelling is you have to sometimes over explain what&rsquo;s happening because the audience can&rsquo;t see it. So it&rsquo;s. Yeah, there&rsquo;s a snake coming straight for me, and it&rsquo;s being lifted from the the the crates, then the hands coming down now, too. So there&rsquo;s a nice little section here where they talk about how dated. Listening to episodes are from the shadow, we&rsquo;ll have a listen to the episode shortly. But it&rsquo;s interesting that even the voice actors. When they hear it back now kind of cringe or recognise how.
Speaker 14
The programme demonstrating the caring, the concern a true star, often feels for the success of his enterprise.
Speaker 11
Funny it is.
Speaker 16
The people looked the. Way you wanted them to look. The places look the way you imagine them and now with television, it&rsquo;s feta compli. I mean, you accept it, and if you don&rsquo;t like it, you turn it off and go to something. House. But that was the beauty of radio it it helped to stimulate the imagination and. In comparison, now they sound very corny. When you listen to some of these old shows. Because we&rsquo;ve made such tremendous strides. Technically, and also performance wise. In radio, everything had to be spelled out in large capital letters so that, you know, I&rsquo;ve got you covered with this gun, you know, so that it was clear to the audience what was happening. Which today makes it seem kind of corny, but that was the beauty of radio. And that&rsquo;s the thing that I think is is missing in our entertainment today.
Craig
It&rsquo;s interesting also that point when you&rsquo;re at a disruptive media technology moment. So here we have people trained and made their professional career in radio. Bemoaning what&rsquo;s been lost because of the popularity now of television. Yeah, right. So, of course, this was recorded in, like the 60s and 70s, and this documentary, and they&rsquo;re talking about what it was like creating audio, which they see was better because it had to be more imaginative. You had to do that theatre of the mind.
Speaker 16
Hmm.
Craig
Work and efforts to visualise what&rsquo;s happened.
Taylor
So with the advent of TikTok, what have we?
Craig
Lost. Well, exactly. Now we have similar ballooning of what we&rsquo;ve lost from, I&rsquo;d say AI right, people saying, you know, we&rsquo;re becoming Dumber because we&rsquo;re relying too much on AI. And when entertainment is generated through AI. It&rsquo;s a lesser quality product than when I worked in media before AI, where it was all human creativity. Similar thing happening now. I think in terms of disruptive technology of AI causing people, particularly those that establish their professional careers pre AI to say, you know we&rsquo;re losing.
Taylor
Out. That just reminds me of when I talked about what was it, study gate or whatever it was and that.
Craig
Ah yes.
Taylor
Had all of the. The professional what&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s the code where you&rsquo;ve got read by other people?
Craig
Peer review.
Taylor
Peer reviewed AI? Yeah.
Craig
Yeah, yeah. Episode 87. Listen back chat, GBD.
Taylor
Found in heaps of.
Craig
Them I look, I have fantasies of time travelling with ChatGPT going back in time and just being a sensation. Anyway, that&rsquo;s my own fan fiction. I&rsquo;ll be doing like.
Taylor
I just like to say to the person who&rsquo;s on Twitch.
Craig
Yeah.
Taylor
Saying and it it it, they&rsquo;ve given me a message. I&rsquo;ve received the message, but I&rsquo;m not going to read it out.
Craig
Right. We&rsquo;ve got some comments. Wow. All right, so thank you always for audience engagement. Please keep it coming.
Taylor
Yeah. Yeah. Thank you, Nathan. Or big Nate as he&rsquo;s.
Craig
Known Nate. Alright, thanks, big Nate. All right, so the next little segment I want to play is the the the cast of the shadow talking about. When the fan audience of the shadow started to blur reality and fiction. OK, so as we do in this show, we often look at moments where. Media blurs reality where people understand reality through media, and it&rsquo;s amusing that you know there, there there are moments where that confusion gets really even superhero characters where you think these this is just Pulp Fiction. Superheroes, really. No one thinks it&rsquo;s real. It&rsquo;s a fun little comment here where they where they. Say, oh, some people thought it was real, OK?
Speaker 14
He&rsquo;s with the shadow as host prior to his becoming the central character. Of the 700 programmes that featured Lamont Cranston, about 200 are known to have survived, and of these, around 100 are available commercially on disc. The 200 programmes in circulation, either commercially or traded among collectors, are fairly evenly divided between performer.
Craig
Sorry, that wasn&rsquo;t. The clip let me find it. Hold on.
Taylor
But.
Speaker 16
They&rsquo;re able. To.
Speaker 7
Then.
Speaker 16
Drop on their.
Speaker 14
Line recently, Grace Matthews recalled how she felt auditioning for the part of Margo Lane in 1946.
Taylor
Just hold.
Craig
On here. OK.
Speaker 16
But he also had the power of Orson Welles.
Speaker 14
For several years in the mid 40&rsquo;s, the shadow programme originated before a live theatre audience. Brett Morrison typically went the extra mile in scenes where Cranston became the shadow and solely for the benefit of the theatre audience. As the radio audience could not see him, Morrison would Don his own Cape and slouch. That to match the appearance of the shadow as he was depicted in the Shadow magazine. Mean. In preparing this programme, we talked with more than a dozen of Morrison&rsquo;s contemporaries on the shadow. Not one had anything but praise for this fine actor.
Speaker 16
This is quite amazing, but you&rsquo;d be surprised how many adults actually thought that Lamont Cranston was a true character who had the power to make himself invisible because toward the end of the programme, or somewhere around? I think when we were in Korea. Yeah. We would receive letters. I&rsquo;d receive letters to people saying. We think it&rsquo;s a crime, that you&rsquo;re keeping the shadow here when he could be spying for our country, you know, again. Ohh yes. Really.
Speaker 4
Really.
Speaker 16
I had no idea that that I&rsquo;ve I&rsquo;ve seen this happen. Identity happen in daytime radio, you know, with characters they they think they actually exist and it&rsquo;s I don&rsquo;t know how they they correlate the time element that that a certain time they&rsquo;re able to eavesdrop on their lives recently grace.
Speaker 9
Isn&rsquo;t. Amazing. Yes, yes, yes.
Craig
It&rsquo;s an interesting point that during the Korean War, when the shadow was broadcast. There were messages coming through letters from fans saying, you know, it&rsquo;s a crime that the shadow, the shadow person, isn&rsquo;t over in Korea helping to win the war by using his powers to spy on the enemy, forgetting this as a fictional character, right. I&rsquo;ve heard this in terms of. Like superhero movies during World War 2, certainly, DC, for instance, never engaged with stories of fighting the Nazis. Yes, there&rsquo;s no episodes where Superman or. Or Wonder Woman, the DC heroes for the Nazis, or the Japanese enemy because they didn&rsquo;t want to diminish the real struggle that real people were facing in the war. That if you&rsquo;ve got someone as super powered as Superman, yes, he would finish the war. But obviously we can&rsquo;t.
Phoebe
Hmm.
Craig
In a.
Phoebe
But.
Craig
Fictional story. Have the war ending when you know GI&rsquo;s are going out, dying every day to win this. So instead they just didn&rsquo;t have storytelling about the the fantasy power of Superman. Here. On the other hand, you have fans then saying, you know well, why don&rsquo;t you send Superman over there to to beat Hitler because. You know, you really need everything, forgetting it&rsquo;s a fictional character. Yeah, like the shadow. The last little segment I wanna play was. It&rsquo;s really fascinating. Like we think about toxic fandom as a modern problem, right? Like George RR Martin constantly getting hassled by fans to release his show. His final episode, final story. There&rsquo;s a great segment. Here where they talk about the toxic fandom that they&rsquo;ve experienced them. Mouths in their professional careers, on the shadow, and it&rsquo;s very similar to. In fact, it seems worse than the problems that we&rsquo;re facing today, particularly the types of toxic behaviour of fans towards the female cast members.
Speaker 9
Cart was going, he was away over most, most all weekends. He went up to Canada to. To. Do the Imperial oil hockey broadcast and he&rsquo;d leave on Friday night and come back Monday morning. And of course, the shadow was on Sunday, so you know, I was there alone, and I had these kids who would phone up and really at first it was kind of fun. They say, ohh. Michael, we&rsquo;ll meet you in the cemetery or something like this. But then finally it got a bit scary and then they would come around to our apartment and lift signs all over with. Kind of. Nasty words and stuff. It was just it got too much, you know. But mostly the the mail was marvellous. It was. It was a great response. I don&rsquo;t know. I mean, you certainly have daytime soap. You got a lot of male soap, but I think it was equally as as big.
Speaker 14
Miss Matthew was recalled.
Craig
So there we go. That toxicity, that faces many fans towards even stars from the Golden Age radio in the 30s. These. Alright, so short include with some music.
Speaker 7
Nice.
Craig
So we&rsquo;re back now, and let&rsquo;s jump into an episode. So we&rsquo;ve kind of set up what the shadow is all about. Crime fighter, immensely popular series. Some people confused from actually being a real person with great powers. I want to jump now into Season 1 Episode 5 with Orson Welles playing the main role. Of the shadow. And it&rsquo;s an episode called the Temple Bells of Naban, first aired October 25th, 1937. It has an entry in TV tropes right? The key tropes that are in this episode is anti magic. The temple bells of Naban, the title of the show. They&rsquo;re actually a charm. Possessed by the antagonist Saudi, and it allows her to defeat the mystical powers of the shadow. Right. That&rsquo;s the first St second rope is drugs are.
Speaker 12
That.
Craig
Right. Because the whole narrative hinges on a heroin drug ring, right? It&rsquo;s incredible to me to think there&rsquo;s a 1937 radio drama directly addressing heroin drug rings. So it&rsquo;s a heroin drug ring that gets a wealthy capitalist son. Addicted and that draws in the attention of the shadow to help save the sun. It&rsquo;s an origins episode. So in this episode we&rsquo;ll hear how Laman Lamont sorry, the main character explains to Margo. That he learned his powers by studying with an Indian priest, the keeper of the Temple of Cobras in Delhi. Wow. So I&rsquo;m sure that&rsquo;s the thing. If we&rsquo;ve typed into Google Maps, we&rsquo;d find that so obviously highly oriental is there, and Margo suggests that he come out into the open as a crime. Right. To which Lamont further explains that he, however, instead operates in the secret as the shadow, for fear that if he did go public, others would learn his secrets that he got from the temple of Cobras in Delhi and used them for evil. There&rsquo;s also the final trope is the snake. Karma trope, again highly oriented horse trope.
Speaker 7
M.
Craig
The main character, Saadi Ben Arda, is an exotic dancer and snake charmer, so yeah, very orientalist, who can use her skills to make a Cobra attack. Of course, in this episode what she doesn&rsquo;t bargain for is that shadow has, as we&rsquo;ll see in the final twist. Small spoiler here switched out her trained cobra with another one and she gets bitten and died. Died dies. Yeah, so it&rsquo;s a great episode basically. Again, it&rsquo;s a nefarious drug ring which is selling dope on the streets of new.
Taylor
Well, there we go.
Craig
They&rsquo;ve made this mistake, though, of ensnaring the son of a VIP and the VIPs demanding action be taken by the police commissioner to save his rich druggies, hunt a bit of origins, some great classics. Fighting. So what we&rsquo;ll do is we&rsquo;ll break it down in terms of some key motifs as well as just broadly before we jump in this idea of exoticism that&rsquo;s in this episode. So this is really peak. 30s Asia exoticism right you have this idea of the main antagonist to a rational Western shadow character. The main antagonist is Saudi Ben Arda, right, an exotic female dancer and snake charmer, right? So it&rsquo;s a heavy trope that aligns with this. Idea of the imaginary Orient. She&rsquo;s also not just. Is she a? Foreigner from India. She&rsquo;s also a mystical person. She&rsquo;s seductive and super dangerous. So again, if if anyone&rsquo;s an Edward Saeed fan who coined the term Orientalism, they&rsquo;ll know this is the classic thing. Saeed says embodies the western fantasy of the east as this irrational and sensual object. Said would argue that.
Taylor
Mm-hmm.
Craig
The character of Saudi Bernarda that we&rsquo;ll listen to in a second. Isn&rsquo;t reflecting a real person from Delhi? There&rsquo;s probably no real person from Delhi that&rsquo;s like this character, Saudi Bernarda. But it&rsquo;s all about Western desire and western fear that we&rsquo;re seeing. So we&rsquo;ll we&rsquo;ll get into some of the setup of the episode and I&rsquo;ll interrupt as certain. Classic Orientalist tropes kick off. OK, so here we go. Let me queue it up. Here we go.
Phoebe
Yeah.
Speaker 17
Safe, healthy and economical fuel, then by all means you can recognise her.
Craig
We&rsquo;ll skip the promo at the. Start here we go.
Speaker 3
They still shadow The Dells of never. They will reveal you.
Speaker 1
Your third mistake, Saudi and your last.
Speaker 3
No, it is your mistake and your last. This is the end of your career as the shadow.
Craig
So that, of course was a little bit of a prelude. The female voice there of Adi Bin Sada, who&rsquo;s the antagonist very much. The opposite of Lamont. The shadow. In terms of the save the cat setup, OK, we&rsquo;re going to start with the 1st 30 seconds, which is a classic kind of. You know, we had a kind of a bit of a classic eerie theme there that we&rsquo;re hearing.
Taylor
Oh yeah, talking about the case.
Craig
And we&rsquo;re going to get the theme set up now around the intro. So we&rsquo;ll listen to how they set up the characters of Lamont and Margo Lamain. Margo lane. Sorry, in this normal world. So it starts in the normal world as they&rsquo;re talking to go to a radio drama. Sorry, a. Theatre plane, yeah.
Speaker 2
Large evening a couple of hours at the club. Caleb does. That intrigue you?
Speaker 4
Lovely, but not too late. I have an appointment at 10. In the morning at the Women&rsquo;s club. They&rsquo;re trying to get them action on this terrible narcotics situation and it stops being peddled all over town. They found schoolchildren using it, society women. Why? It&rsquo;s already called the half dozen suicides.
Speaker 2
Yes, I read about that. I know it&rsquo;s terrible.
Speaker 4
Stuff need the shadow to get at the bottom of it.
Speaker 2
As I know, dear. But for tonight I I do enjoy just being myself. Lamont Cranston. Dilettante. That&rsquo;s be the shadow. Only in real emergency. You know the. In China, there&rsquo;s a lovely Indian dancer at this new club, Caleb.
Speaker 12
Indian dancer.
Speaker 2
You know, there&rsquo;s the place just there have killed driver, yes.
Speaker 4
Lamont, you are going to do something about. It you&rsquo;ll start.
Speaker 2
It already, perhaps. Yeah, we are right. Drive up. What? Thank you, Sir.
Speaker 4
Ohh, that looked like young. Jerry Clayton just going in, yes.
Speaker 2
I was that young man&rsquo;s father. I&rsquo;d spank him and keep him home occasionally.
Speaker 4
Spoiled son of a wealthy style.
Speaker 2
Yeah. Let me have your code. I&rsquo;ll check it with mine.
Speaker 4
Good evening, Jerry.
Speaker 10
Oh. Oh, hello, Miss lane.
Speaker 4
Good father and sister. Well, I haven&rsquo;t seen them lately.
Speaker 10
Yes, yes, I&rsquo;m sorry, but I can&rsquo;t wait right now. I&rsquo;ve got to see someone, and it&rsquo;s important. I&rsquo;m sorry.
Speaker 2
Hello.
Speaker 4
I don&rsquo;t know if you don&rsquo;t get upset about something. He doesn&rsquo;t look well, either pale and shaky.
Speaker 2
You&rsquo;re right, it doesn&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m curious about that boy.
Phoebe
Umm.
Speaker 2
Well, let&rsquo;s go in.
Speaker 17
And show you to the tables.
Speaker 4
There&rsquo;s someone getting up. To speak, we seem to just in time. For the main attraction.
Speaker 17
Ladies and gentlemen, we take pleasure in presenting the fascinating and beautiful dancer of the Far East, Sadie Bell. Her first number tonight, she will give you the dance of the Cobra. Zadie Bel? Ada.
Speaker 4
Look, she&rsquo;s lovely.
Speaker 2
Yes, real thing too real Hindu.
Phoebe
Hmm.
Speaker 2
That&rsquo;s odd you. Know.
Speaker 3
Look, she&rsquo;s taking.
Speaker 4
A snake out of that wicked bat.
Speaker 2
A live cobra.
Speaker 4
Oh, heaven.
Speaker 2
Another Cobra is connected with the old Indian mysticism, the most ancient of magic. See how she quiets. The snake makes its way to the motion of her hens. It&rsquo;s a form of mesmerism. They never improved on it with all our modern psychology.
Speaker 4
I hope it&rsquo;s there within remote.
Speaker 2
Well, they undoubtedly have. Ohh. This is the one they call Saadi bin Lada. Jerry Gleason, with that strange look in his eyes. An epidemic of narcotic smuggling. Saudi bin laden.
Speaker 3
What is who she is.
Speaker 4
She keeps looking over here. Lamont. Yeah.
Speaker 2
It&rsquo;s coming this way well.
Speaker 3
You will need for the beautiful lady star. Oh.
Speaker 4
Oh, a bracelet. Thank you.
Speaker 3
Ohh, you know the tongue of Mother India? Sad.
Speaker 2
Only enough to make a small prayer only enough for that.
Speaker 13
Sadly, bell ada.
Speaker 3
It is good sometime to know a small prayer.
Speaker 2
Hmm, just in case of an emergency.
Speaker 3
Yeah. You are very welcome in case you should meet someone who could destroy you. Bella.
Phoebe
Just.
Speaker 4
What did she mean by that?
Phoebe
I.
Speaker 2
Don&rsquo;t know exactly. Funny something. She seems to know something about me. And trying to recall where I&rsquo;ve seen that face.
Phoebe
Yes.
Craig
So the story. Keeps building up as there&rsquo;s more revelations of the drug crime that&rsquo;s going on and turns out that main protagonist there that was introduced. The female Mystic Saudi Bernarda, the snake charmer is in. Cahoots with the local? Port captain and they&rsquo;re importing all of this heroin into New York and getting wealthy claim until hooked on it and then scamming them for their money. What&rsquo;s really interesting there is, again, establishing that the protagonist, antagonist tension is built around that Orientalism, right? You have the protagonist, the shadow, the Western trained superhero who went to India to get his his skill set. Who&rsquo;s here confronted with someone that. That seems to know what he&rsquo;s about. Never met them sadly bin Laden, but seems to understand and, you know, is the opposite. The antagonist, you know, mystical, seductive, dangerous. You&rsquo;ve got this kind of rational West, right? So who&rsquo;s talking about the power of mysticism and the power of the snake charm? Even we in our in the West have not been able to control this hypnotism verse because it&rsquo;s this versus this irrational.
Taylor
Yeah. We&rsquo;ve got another comment on the Twitch.
Craig
Eastern other.
Phoebe
Great, yes.
Taylor
And it says and and I&rsquo;ll let you answer this one. What is the topic of discussion today? I&rsquo;ve got this on in the background whilst I play Flight Flight simulator and I have no clue what&rsquo;s going.
Craig
We&rsquo;re deep diving into a classic 1930s and 40s golden age of radio drama called.
Taylor
The shadow on Edge radio. No, no, no one.
Craig
Of them. And we are unpacking how this late 30s episode in particular sets up some really fascinating Oriental. Images of Asia that were commonplace in the West at that point because both of us have been getting into Cyberpunk 2077, and it has. The kind of 80s view of the Asian other. So we&rsquo;re looking at what the 1930s Asian other was. So in this case the antagonist is this kind of, you know, feminine presence. She&rsquo;s irrational. We&rsquo;ll skip to the end where this kind of barbaric. Other is coming into place because the shadow of course, is a rational, civilised, masculine figure, whereas Ali bin Laden is an irrational, barbaric, feminine figure. So let&rsquo;s listen to the end as the final conflict occur. So basically leading up to this, we&rsquo;ve had a series of story beats. If we&rsquo;re breaking this down instead of in terms of Blake Snyder&rsquo;s classic, save the cat narrative, the theme gets stated there, right? The shadows power. Of invisibility and hypnotic suggestion seems to have met its match in Ali bin Laden right. The snake charmer seems to understand what what his power set is. It seems to have a deeper understanding of it. Possibly. Yeah, right. So there&rsquo;s a setup, the catalyst. There&rsquo;s a murder that occurs at the end of Act one, which then draws the shadow in to try and solve what this murder is about. It&rsquo;s linked to the drug trade that&rsquo;s going on. Then the reveal is that Ali been in such.
Taylor
Bin laden. And you&rsquo;re gonna say it, Osama bin Laden.
Craig
Bin Laden has this necklace that has the temple bells of naban in it, right? It&rsquo;s twinkle thing that will basically counter the shadow. Those ability to become invisible. All right. Again, all kind of mystery as to how that occurs. There&rsquo;s a bit of fun and games. The shadow looks like the bad guys are closing in on him. And how is he going to?
Speaker 7
M.
Craig
Counteract the power set of the antagonist. All seems to be lost. We hit The Dark Knight of the soul points, or it seems that the shadow won&rsquo;t be able to defeat her because he can&rsquo;t use his normal hidden skill advantage that he&rsquo;s going to dig deeper.
Speaker 7
Hmm.
Craig
To outsmart her. And then we head into this finale where the the character of Sada bin Laden Ada is defeated. So let&rsquo;s jump into that now and we&rsquo;ll have a listen to that, and then we&rsquo;ll break it down in terms of. Some of the key orientalist tropes.
Speaker 11
No one can get through those, not even a shell. Save your love, whoever you are, we&rsquo;ve got you. You&rsquo;re in this cabin somewhere, and this ship is outward bound. Laugh that.
Speaker 1
I think you may have made three mistakes, Captain. One too many. Yes, captain.
Speaker 3
But I do not make mistakes that.
Speaker 1
That remains to be seen, Zade villada.
Speaker 3
Then you will see. And with the weaker basket like.
Speaker 14
What do? You want to do? Yes, daddy.
Speaker 3
I call the temple bell the Niban captain. The shadow has the power to blind your eyes, but trick he learned in India from a Yogi who was my uncle. But I have a better trip. When the last bell sounds, while the sacred Cobra dancing, you will see the shadow only at the man. Be ready to shoot, Captain.
Speaker 11
I&rsquo;m ready.
Speaker 3
And now my cobra to dance with the bells of Nevada.
Speaker 1
I wouldn&rsquo;t open that basket if I were you, Sadie Villada.
Speaker 3
You watch my pretty COBRA sale. He may find you even before the captain&rsquo;s bullets. You will die just as quickly.
Speaker 1
Dead cobras are better plaything than live ones.
Speaker 3
Make your small prayer style. And now my pretty one, digging good done.
Phoebe
Be careful.
Speaker 11
The Cobra moves towards you.
Speaker 3
My own pretty cobra, he knows me. You hear the bell shadow? The temple bell.
Speaker 1
I hear them.
Speaker 3
When the last cell right? We shall see our prisoner.
Speaker 11
And I am waiting for that minute. I&rsquo;m sorry.
Speaker 17
Sadly.
Speaker 15
Sorry.
Speaker 1
The shadow warned you, Sade bin Laden.
Speaker 11
You take credit, but they still.
Speaker 1
Do you know? They should have known it was not her cobra in the Wicker basket. It was mine.
Phoebe
Use.
Speaker 14
Dead.
Speaker 11
What&rsquo;s that? Who is it?
Speaker 17
The police reported. No. Please. Captain Malin, you do not shoot.
Craig
All right. And that&rsquo;s not the police breaking into the studio. We&rsquo;re not being taken off air by a sudden interruption of the police. But at the end of the 1930. 8 episode. Of the shadow called the temple bells of Naban, I do like that moment where I mean, maybe on the comments for this video of the temple built, many people complained that the the character of Sada Bernarda is is really good. It&rsquo;s a good foil to the shadow because again, much like there&rsquo;s Orientalist. Oops, it&rsquo;s the antithesis. While the shadow is this rational masculine figure. You are kind of hyper rational here. We have this kind of mystical, seductive female dangerous other. Who can confront him? Who can call him out on his mysticism? Because she&rsquo;s trained in the same stuff and better at it with her snake. So of course, how does he get around? How does he get around the snake? He uses his rational detective skills to switch out the snake, and she is. Then bitten by her own hubris, her own feeling that she has power over the snake. To to die and. Unfortunately, killed off as a as a as a. Villain. Yeah, in that episode. Yes. So we have some nice kind of mysticism, heavy preparation of the eastern wisdom idea. I reckon you could do a counter reading of that where instead of. You know, like the the rise of the the colonial oppressed because obviously here we have the the colonial appropriation of knowledge that the the the skill of Lamont is that idea that he&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s gone to India, Tindall. These skills the West has absorbed eastern wisdom. But stripped it. Of all its context, right and reduced it down to, you know, just a kind of, you know, in terms of. The antagonist kind of villainous backwards character, but you could convert that she could, you know, triumph for the other. Possibly. I mean it&rsquo;s one of the limitations I guess, of the Western imagining that this is very much the western point of view. Would an Indian story be different, you know where the shadow is actually the bad guy?
Taylor
So at the moment my mind is just drifting away from what you&rsquo;re saying because you were talking about East and West and then that just reminded me of when we were in Japan together and we had cheats.
Craig
OK.
Taylor
Always cheater. That was at KFC, KFC and we had chicken pizza.
Speaker 11
Yes, right.
Taylor
When my mind was.
Craig
Going well. Look. Yeah, I think that&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s an interesting point in terms of I think that. Yeah. OK. So I think that&rsquo;s really a good point to end on. Yeah, because what I find really fascinating is here we have Western stories about Asia, right? So the character. Of the shadow. Is he refers to India, he refers going to India becoming mystical. We&rsquo;re introduced to an Indian character, the snake charmer, dance woman. But it&rsquo;s not written from their point of view right? Then you can have.
Speaker 17
Hmm.
Craig
Moments where what does that? Subjective other. In this case India. But in our case, Japan. Do when it takes the West. Yeah. Right. So for the KFC Western food. They don&rsquo;t treat it as what we would eat in the West. They recombined it, rehydrated it into a chicken pizza.
Speaker 7
Yeah, yeah.
Taylor
Chicken pizza pizza.
Craig
Pizza and next week we might get around to it if we have some time with the idea of Cyberpunk 2077 equally was started as. Western imaging. Of the rise of power in Asia. So you had a dominant Japanese automobile industry in the 70s. You had a dominant Japanese economy that was in many ways fearful from the West, right? The West was seeing it as a power source. That it couldn&rsquo;t. Triumph against sins in terms of automobile. Sales, technology quality and other things. So they started doing this cyberpunk stuff about what a horrible, dystopic world this is headed into, but then you have Akira Ghost in the Shell films made in Japan for a Japanese audience, which instead of taking the kind of, you know, where I kind of subjugated other, recenter it as they&rsquo;re the main characters in that. That Orientalist fantasy and.
Taylor
What reminds me what? What does? What does? What does Vietnam do when the West goes into view?
Craig
Yes. Yeah, all these and more.
Taylor
Because because because the French go go.
Craig
In Yep, the colonial.
Taylor
Period. And then Vietnam takes the baguettes and the mayonnaise and puts it everywhere. Yeah.
Craig
Right. So one can have these hybrid cuisine moments. Yeah. Yeah. Look, and I think food is probably the most constructive. Globalised. Yeah. Consequence like the chica role in anyway is going way off topic. Now, the chica you never had.
Speaker 3
What is that?
Craig
A chica roll. Baby.
Taylor
It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s kind of like.
Craig
For. It&rsquo;s a spring roll, but it&rsquo;s.
Taylor
Yeah, spring roll, but done in like a a more a more pastry.
Speaker 7
Yeah, it&rsquo;s.
Craig
Yeah. It&rsquo;s like a combination. Of a yeah, pasty and a spiral, yeah. Anyway, way off topic.
Taylor
No. Corn jacks are better, actually. They&rsquo;re filled with corn instead.
Craig
So that&rsquo;s a. Little start in terms of us starting to explore ideas of Orientalism today.
Taylor
Cyberpunk. Cyberpunk. Cyberpunk.
Craig
Yeah. We&rsquo;re gonna go into the techno Orientalism in coming weeks, so keep listening to.
Taylor
Ohh, we&rsquo;ve got. We&rsquo;ve got another. Comment. Comment. Yeah, not on the actual request line.
Craig
Oh, right, right. Yep. Thank you for that. Interesting. So the comment reads interesting to touch on the cyberpunk theme from the Western Japanese perspective. Ken. Yes, thank you, Ken. Exactly. So that I think is a really rich area where we can see storytelling happening at both ends, both the western view of Asia, particularly Japan in cyberpunk.
Speaker 7
Hmm.
Craig
And then later on we can see the reappropriation of that discourse in anime like Akira and Ghost in the Shell, which does something completely different with those same motifs of, you know, body modification through technology and the rise of Asian power in multinational companies. That&rsquo;s.
Taylor
Yep.
Craig
Alright. Yep. OK. So we&rsquo;re we&rsquo;re really at time now. Thanks for listening everyone. I hope you found that deep dive into the shadow. Interesting do listen to. The shadow. It&rsquo;s fascinating. Series then.
Taylor
Well, yeah, well, you know.
Craig
As the actors themselves said, I mean maybe falling to sleep to it, listen to you&rsquo;re going to fall asleep to you&rsquo;re on a long drive. There&rsquo;s some really quality storytelling, but you need to understand it&rsquo;s for audio. So there are those corny moments where they&rsquo;re over explaining the physicality of it. Like that scene where she&rsquo;s saying.
Speaker 11
Yeah.
Craig
Ohh, there&rsquo;s a snake coming out of the basket and you notice how the snake is moving side by side following the arms is so they&rsquo;re.
Taylor
They&rsquo;re they do it, they do it a lot more better in more modern things, so.
Phoebe
But.
Taylor
And. No. Yeah, like with Big Finish Doctor Who.
Craig
Story. Yes. Yeah, yeah. So the storytelling, you know, has has increasingly become more and more effective. Yes. All right. That&rsquo;s the medium mothership for another week. Thanks for listening. In next week, we&rsquo;ll jump into some more. Stuff. Thanks again for all those that are commenting. Taylor will decide how to deal with those comments as they come through.
Taylor
Punk. Ohh dear. So no, I&rsquo;m not going to respond to that. Probably not, yeah.
Craig
And I was like, listening next week, we&rsquo;re research, time permitting, we&rsquo;ll dive into techno Orientalism and cyber.
Taylor
Let me research, time permitting, I&rsquo;m 100% talking about it next.
Speaker 7
Time.
Craig
Week, OK, OK. There we go, guaranteed.
Taylor
Thanks. Yeah.
Craig
Name. Actually, this has been Craig Norris for another week, joined by. Taylor and Phoebe.
Taylor
Yeah, goodbye.
Craig
Thank you so much for joining us with your magical kalimba.

<p>Using Blake Snyder&rsquo;s (2005) framework from <em>Save the Cat</em>, along with media theories from Slavoj Žižek and Stuart Hall, we will uncover the compelling story structure and the unstoppable horror tropes it embodies. We will also examine its cultural impact through insights from Stephen King&rsquo;s analysis of radio horror and Bill Cosby&rsquo;s comedic retelling.</p>

      Craig
Alright, welcome here to media mothership here on Edge Radio 99.3 FM.
Speaker 3
What made half life, Alex there we.
Speaker
OK. Yeah.
Craig
Go. Yes. Alright. So as always, we&rsquo;re using the wonderful technology from Edge Radio studios here at Nepal, Luna, Hobart TAS. And I&rsquo;m your host, Craig. On this show, we explore how media can cheap our understanding of the world around us. Last week we took a deep dive into various parts of pop culture, including some and. Or Star Wars? Stuff and a little bit of discussion of anime as well as some news and current pop culture topics. Today&rsquo;s topic we&rsquo;re going to do a huge deep dive into. Horror and radio. I came across some really fascinating discussion from Stephen King in his book dance Macabre, talking about the impact of radio, effectively conveying horror. So we&rsquo;re going to listen to a classic short 7 minute. Horror. Drama called Chicken Hearts Chicken Heart the most unlikely of things that could drive horror into the heart of a listener. So we listen to that. Some people might also know of chicken heart from the fantastic, though now problematic Bill Cosby sketch that he did in one of his early live up. Live stand up albums we&rsquo;ll we&rsquo;ll. Unpack all of that. That and a whole bunch of other stuff on media mothership today, but the main question is, you know, this, this, this idea of how it has seven minute radio drama from 1937 can still I, I reckon haunt pop culture today. I reckon there&rsquo;s some. Lessons and some interesting. Political reverberations that chicken hearts. Echoes with today&rsquo;s politics, particularly the news we&rsquo;re hearing out of California and the kind of. Trump military police crackdown that&rsquo;s going on there I. Think there&rsquo;s chicken heart? Is in conversation with even scary politics like that today. So keep listening to. Media mothership with myself Craig here on Edge Radio, 99.3 FM. Of course. If you do have any comments while we&rsquo;re doing today, show you can SMS US directly in the studio on 0488811707 or reach out to us via the live stream. On YouTube and Twitch. OK, welcome back now. Musical accompaniment, the thumb, Hogan. Chicken hearts. So I guess to set up this idea of how a 7 minute radio drama from way back in 1937 still packs a punch. Or does it?
Speaker
We&rsquo;ll, we&rsquo;ll, we&rsquo;ll.
Craig
Look a little bit about the history first of it, why this kind of? Matters so chicken Hearts broadcast 1937. It&rsquo;s written by one of the big names in radio dramas, particular horror Arch Oboler, and he wrote for the radio drama series mainly lights out. We&rsquo;ll listen to the Bill Cosby sketch, which kind of amps up the experience of watching. Or sorry, of listening to radio dramas like Light Sounds briefly before we dive into listening to it, the the story of Chicken Heart is is basically a scientific experiment which goes horribly wrong. You know, it starts with this idea of a checking. And then as we&rsquo;ll hear. Things escalate into this crazy panic. To put it in a little bit of context, I guess you got to understand that at the time this was written in the 1930s, you&rsquo;ve got this really cool, fascinating glimpse into some of the I reckon the key anxieties. That were echoing or that were occurring in that time in the late 30s. Think about it. I mean, here we are pretty much in the Golden Age of radio in the 30s. You know, television has certainly not. Made an impact, right? You you really needing to earn to the 50s and 60s? Nineteen 30S was still dominated by radio. Radio was the form of of popular entertainment and communication and a series like lights, Lights out. And this is one of the early episodes. From it is part of what was making radio drama something so exciting for people to listen into. Now, importantly, some of you. Guys might have. Heard of the classic media panic radio drama that was Orson Welles? War of the world? That was the one, of course, that led to a huge panic around the power of media and radio to again shape the way people perceived reality around them. You know, war of the worlds based on HD World&rsquo;s Classic novel was broadcast in radio, formed by Orson Welles and done in such a manner. That people thought the live broadcast that was occurring was actually happening. And again it did that by echoing some of the broadcasts that were happening at that point from the. Blitz that was occurring on England during World War Two from the German air bombings and evoking that sense of disaster, the Hindenburg disaster, which was broadcast on radio. So again this. Chicken heart occurs one year, so it&rsquo;s broadcast to one year before war of the Worlds, but I think it sets up the same type of media panic and certainly Bill Cosby&rsquo;s comedy sketch about his experience listening to Chicken Heart is all about. The media panic he experienced listening to chicken heart. So we&rsquo;ll play a little bit of that Bill Cosby thing as well as the Stephen King analysis of Chicken Heart shortly. But before we go any further, the other thing to listen out for I guess is this idea that in the 1930s you got to see this movement of of kind of science and medicine. That&rsquo;s going through incredibly rapid advancements. You know, we&rsquo;ve only had flights occurring, you know, in the 1913 era. So 1930s is only 20 years after flights. You&rsquo;ve got the expansion of a number of technologies, including radio itself. Of. So. Chicken Heart is is kind of in conversation with some of these fears and you know, kind of technological determinism that is taking up around science at the moment. The kind of humorous of science and 37, I mean, while World War 2 hasn&rsquo;t occurred yet, that won&rsquo;t be until 1939. And Germanys&rsquo;s invasion of Poland. Nevertheless, you&rsquo;ve still got. What is it? I think the Marco Polo incidents occurred with Japan and China launching that conflict between Japan going through into China. So we&rsquo;re really at the brink of World War 2 during this time. I mean, there&rsquo;s a lot of of of stress that&rsquo;s occurring here. I mean, Hitler&rsquo;s in power, Hitler&rsquo;s starting to gobble up little spots. I&rsquo;m not sure if Czechoslovakia. Or so Dayton land has fallen into Germany yet, but it&rsquo;s right around that period. You&rsquo;ve got Chamberlain, you&rsquo;ve got piercement occurring. We&rsquo;re at the brink of war, right? It&rsquo;s certainly gearing up. So I think this, this theme that we&rsquo;ll hear about in chicken heart of. And unstoppable destructive force. Is is certainly. I think in conversation with that point in history, so a little bit of media induced panic. So as you&rsquo;re listening to this, think about, you know, if you turn the lights out literally the name of the horror serial, this is broadcast in it&rsquo;s lights out. So turn those lights out. Listen to this episode. Think about whether it could induce a bit of panic. What&rsquo;s also interesting about? The final point about chicken heart before we listen to. Is, as we&rsquo;ll unpack. The fact that you&rsquo;ve got some really memorable comedy interpretations. Yeah, Bill Cosby&rsquo;s famous retelling as well as it being in Stephen King&rsquo;s book dance Macabre, which is his analysis of horror as a genre, what makes horror work. And he talked specifically about chicken heart. So let&rsquo;s give a listen now to the 1937 chicken heart. This has been remastered again. It&rsquo;s a classic from radio. Horror. And created by Arch Uber. You know one of the big masters of. Terror that we&rsquo;ll listen to. So here is chicken heart. We&rsquo;ll play the whole thing. It only goes to 7 minutes. 40 seconds. So sit back, enjoy, grab a coffee or tea and listen to chicken heart.
Speaker 4
Do you remember some time ago in an eastern scientific institution? They kept the peace of heart alive for weeks on end. Well, I got to thinking, what if that heart began to grow? And grow and grow. Grow.
Speaker 5
Hello. Hello. Operator. Give me Mr Reagan fast. Hello, Mr Reagan. This is Lewis. Listen, get me a rewrite, man. The things still growing. No cheap. I tell you the truth. That corridors choked with living, crawling flesh. No, no, no, I&rsquo;m not drunk. I&rsquo;m telling you the truth. That little piece of flesh has grown until now. It&rsquo;s. Jamming that building. All inside the space of an hour. You&rsquo;ve got to believe me. It&rsquo;s the greatest news story of the generation. And here you argue with me. I tell you, it&rsquo;s the truth. You&rsquo;ve got to believe in you.
Speaker 3
You must believe me, I tell you, the only hope is to burn the building to. The ground that one. Now, wait a minute. Wait. A minute. Take it. I tell you. Burn it to the. Ground burn and I tell you, take it. Easy. I sent in a call. Don&rsquo;t you understand? For some reason I cannot even imagine, this tissue is doubling in size every hour. Do you know what that means? In another hour it will be twice the size it is now, and long before that it will break open the building with the force of its pressure, and then it will be free in the street. Do you hear me? Free. On the street and then those those tentacles of protoplasm stretching out to feed on anything they can reach.
Speaker 6
What&rsquo;s happening? You see the walls cracking? They want. I want you.
Speaker 3
I tried to warn them. But now it is too late. The heart is free.
Speaker 8
Where is it?
Speaker 7
Gentlemen, gentlemen, come to order. Please, gentlemen. Please. Quiet, quiet, please. Please. Please now as mayor, no one realises more than I do the necessity of immediate action in terming this unspeakable unbelievable emergency. Can I assure you that I.
Speaker 8
I cut the speeches, Mike, that blasted thing is spreading like a forest fire. All the governor.
Speaker 7
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, Please wait here. Is Doctor Albert from the Research Institute. Speak. Step up here. Doctor, do so.
Speaker 9
Aaron.
Speaker 10
Let&rsquo;s see what he says.
Speaker 3
Gentlemen. It was in my institute this horror began. And if you give me a chance, perhaps I can stop it. What is your?
Speaker 7
Doctor, tell us first what that monster really is, yes.
Speaker 3
Yes, I will tell you that great ever growing mass of flesh it is or it was a chicken heart.
Speaker 7
Hard. Are you crazy?
Speaker 5
Men.
Speaker 7
Yes. Chicken heart. Chicken heart. Listen to me, you fool. Listen, listen. Up there, who knows what he&rsquo;s talking about.
Speaker 3
I tell you that mass of flesh was a chicken heart, the tissue of which for some reason is undergoing constant, rapid, accelerating growth with every passing hour, its growth is doubling. Do you know what that means? If it is now one block in size within 30 hours, that cannibal flesh will have increased in size. To 1 square block to the 30th power in 30 hours. Every inch of this whole city will be crushed under that moving. Within 60 hours it will have covered the entire state within two weeks, the entire United States. You ask for the National Guard. I say call out the entire army. We&rsquo;ll ask this thing off the earth.
Speaker 8
Already Keith pumpers already all hoses coupled up. We&rsquo;ll flood that thing with water from all.
Speaker 10
Angles alright, here&rsquo;s the signal.
Speaker 7
Open them up full blast.
Speaker 8
Chief work out. That&rsquo;s reaching out. Get back everybody, everybody.
Speaker 3
Is what good is water? I told them the only hope is artillery. Bums.
Speaker 10
All National Guardsmen report to your armouries. All National Guardsmen report to your armouries. General mobilisation.
Speaker 8
Battery in position, Sir.
Speaker 10
Firing on the album.
Speaker 7
Sir.
Speaker 11
Then.
Speaker 3
Aye.
Speaker 9
Hi here.
Speaker 3
Useless. It has grown too large and it grows too quickly. The flesh is already engulfing the guns. They came too late.
Speaker 5
You all right now, Doctor Albert? Yes.
Speaker 3
Yes, I&rsquo;m all right, Mr. Lewis.
Speaker 5
Well, I sure am glad I located you. I stole as long as I could. Another 10 minutes and we could have taken off that blasted protoplasm or whatever it is was sucking at the wheels by the. Time we left the. Yes, yes, I saw 5000 feet. Well, we&rsquo;ll cruise around up here for a few minutes and. Then head W it will.
Speaker 3
Do no good.
Speaker 5
You can&rsquo;t mean it it it must stop growing sometime it must.
Speaker 3
Look at it down there. The grey blankets of evil covering. See how the roads are black with men and women and their children running for their lives. See how the protoplasmic grave reaches out and engulfs them. See.
Speaker 5
Stop it. Stop talking like that. We&rsquo;ll get away the government. They&rsquo;ll send bombing planes, poison gas.
Speaker 3
No. Listen to me, Lewis. You remember only a handful of days ago you asked me my prophecy of the end of the. With you remember my answer? Ohh such a scholarly prophecy. Cessation of Earth rotation. Mighty sounding astronomical theories. But now this is reality. Lewis. The end has come for humanity. Not in the red of atomic fusion. Not in the glory of interstellar combustion. Not in the piece of white. Hold silence, but with that, that creeping, grasping flesh below us. It is a joke. Hey, Lewis, a great joke. The joke of the cosmos. The end of mankind.
Speaker 6
No.
Speaker 11
Oh.
Speaker 3
Because of the chickens.
Speaker 9
No, we won&rsquo;t die. I can&rsquo;t die. I&rsquo;ll find a safe landing somewhere. I&rsquo;ll find a place. The motor. It&rsquo;s cut out. We&rsquo;re a spin. I can&rsquo;t get.
Speaker 3
Out of it, I told you, doom. No, no mankind. Doom. No.
Speaker 9
We&rsquo;re falling right into it, into the heart.
Craig
All right. There we have it. The chicken heart. One of the classic all time horror. Radio dramas. Let&rsquo;s break this down first in terms of bleak Snyders see if the cat theory or script writing we&rsquo;ve. Looked at black, bleak. Snyder, before he has proposed a number of ways in which, if you want to write a great movie, there&rsquo;s. Specific number of story beats. You&rsquo;ve gotta make sure you tick off. Let&rsquo;s see if breaking down. Chicken hearts align strongly and reveals this kind of classic story build building structure that saves the cat is built around, so Snyder starts with the idea that you&rsquo;ve got to start strongly with a good opening image. You&rsquo;ve got to establish the world through that so. The radio drama Chicken Heart starts with the scientist talking about, you know, remember when they were able to create a heart. So establishing the idea of science, establishing the idea of science, being able to create amazing things. And this idea of hubris, right, that we&rsquo;re we&rsquo;re setting up this. Environment this this world where humans are masters over nature, they&rsquo;re able to create anything they want, including a heart. So that&rsquo;s the establishing image that first seen and we quickly go to the reporter setting up the theme, which is the report is calling back to his office. With a panic tone staying, you know? Ohh my God. It&rsquo;s about to explode, right? The building that the heart was in as as, as you know, the the the heart&rsquo;s been growing, it&rsquo;s going to burst the walls and we have the scientists trying to warn everyone that this thing is just going to keep growing. So that&rsquo;s kind of setting up this theme of of scientific ambition and and panic. Around the consequences if they become uncontrollable, so that that&rsquo;s pretty much immediately the second scene we see that nicely as Snyder is saying, establishing the theme. You know panic. Scientific hubris, unchecked experiment, and then we have this setup as the hearts growing. We&rsquo;re becoming aware of it. The fourth story beat that Snyder talks about is is an inciting incident. And it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s around I guess the the walls have broken from the building that contain the hearts. So I&rsquo;d say that&rsquo;s probably the scene that&rsquo;s the inciting incident. The fact that this heart is now growing uncontrollably, that&rsquo;s the catalyst that then sets up the rest of the story, which is how are we going to stop this heart? Growing. Right. What&rsquo;s going on? They&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re. They&rsquo;re now realising that this scientific experiment is spiralling out of control, so we have seen five. Well story 5, which is the debate. Can it be stopped? So we have this classic scene where scientists, the mayors there and they&rsquo;re all struggling to figure out how they&rsquo;re going to fix this. They&rsquo;re debating. Possible solutions? So we break now into Act 2. This is storytelling .6, which is the point of no return, right? So at this point the heart has continued to escape containment. We have the great scene. Where the local authorities are trying to use water, right, they&rsquo;ve got the hoses out and they&rsquo;re just trying to hose it down and it&rsquo;s not working right. So there&rsquo;s a sense of dread that&rsquo;s creeping in that the world now is in full crisis mode. Water is not worked. The scientist has said, I told the fools what wouldn&rsquo;t work. They&rsquo;ve got to use artillery and bombs. Alright. So then we move into storytelling beat 7, which is fun and games. As the horror escalates. You&rsquo;ve got the great scenes of that, you know, artillery being called in, the bombs being directed, the militaries involved, all these escalating panic movements as they&rsquo;re futilely, they&rsquo;re futile, ISM, they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re not able to destroy the heart with any of the fun and games. That Snyder refers to as this story beat as we see a series of of kind of kind of core horror spectacles being described to us in the radio drama. There&rsquo;s no real sense of well, there&rsquo;s a kind of a false hope, right? So the false hope would be that scene near the end where the scientist is on the. The aeroplane, right. We had that scene where the his, his assistant or or helper has managed to get the aeroplane off the ground. The scientist that was involved in the research has made it onto that aeroplane and. And it. It&rsquo;s a kind of midpoint, false hope moment where it looks like they might be able to get out of it. Right. So the pilots say, you know, we&rsquo;ll just circle around a bit. We&rsquo;ll try to figure out what to do next. But that effort is all in fail because we&rsquo;re at Story Week 9, which is the bad guys closing right this chicken heart, the bad guy, the villain, the force of Nature has continued to expand. The scientist in the aeroplane is just saying it&rsquo;s all hopeless. Destruction is inevitable. Story bit 10 all is lost, right? There&rsquo;s a final realisation, right? The the pilots refusing to acknowledge this. I know I can&rsquo;t die now. This can&rsquo;t happen. But who&rsquo;s lost? And we&rsquo;re now into a full dystopic, pessimistic story with story beat 11 dark night of the soul. So the scientist and the pilots in the aeroplane now confronts their powerlessness, right? And the scientist. Kind of reflects on his own humour. This, and we reached this wonderful kind of finale right where the growth of the hearts being recognised as impossible to stop this kind of ultimate horror is being seen below them. He&rsquo;s talking about the grey heart, the little black dots of people trying to escape. We have the finale where this height is is is consuming everything and that that theme of that we established in scene one with the reporters cooling his base at the scientists saying, you know, those fools have got to listen to. Me that these unchecked forces are now beyond human control, with a wonderful final image.
Speaker 1
Which is a.
Craig
Sound effect image, of course. For radio of the splats of the the aeroplane losing its engine right and spiralling out of control, and this wonderful final sound of the SPLAT as the aeroplane crashes into the heart. So it&rsquo;s certainly a really strong. Story in terms of breaking it down in those fourteen save the cat story beats in terms of where Snyder would place this as a genre. As you know, he he defines genres in terms of specifically memorable thought. So it&rsquo;s not a horror genre. He would say this is a monster in the house. Subgenre right where you have this unstoppable force, right. The monster in the house, which is just wreaking havoc in this case due to human error. Right, the scientists tubers. And it&rsquo;s got that classic structure that follows the kind of escalating tension and inevitable doom story. So it&rsquo;s considered a classic of being able to map that out. It&rsquo;s a wonderful kind of inevitable doom. 7 minutes, 7 1/2. And it&rsquo;s packs in a lot. And again, Bill Cosby&rsquo;s little comedy routine on his experience as a child listening to this drives that home. But before you get to Bill Cosby, let&rsquo;s listen to how Stephen King, the well known horror author, explains why he thinks. Chicken heart matters. And it&rsquo;s really important to listen to, even to it now. So this is in Stephen King&rsquo;s dance macabre book, which is his writing about why horror works, how it works in movies, how it works in literature, and what we&rsquo;re going to be hearing about is, is a little snippet from the audio book. Created by William Derfus derfus. So we&rsquo;ll listen to hear Steven you talking about the importance of radio horror and in particular, the author of it, Arch Ublas. Chicken heart.
Speaker 1
3. We&rsquo;re almost done with our brief discussion of radio. Now. I think that to do much more would be to risk droning along like one of those tiresome cinema buffs want to spend the night telling you how Charlie Chaplin was the greatest screen actor who ever lived, or that the Clint Eastwood spaghetti Westerns stand at the apex of the existential absurdist movement. But no discussion of the phenomenon of radio terror, no matter how brief, would be complete without some mention of the genres Primo 2. Not Orson Welles, but Arch Oboler, the first playwright to have his own National Radio series, the chilling Lights out. Lights out was actually broadcast in the 40s, but enough of the programmes were rebroadcast in the 50s and even in the 60s. For me to feel I can justify their inclusion here. The one I remember most vividly from its rebroadcast on Dimension X was the chicken heart that ate the world oboler like so many people in the horror field, Alfred Hitchcock, as another prime example, are extremely alert to the humour implicit in horror, and this alertness was never on better view than in the chicken. Art story made you giggle at its very absurdity, even as the goose flesh raced up and down your arms.
Speaker
Which?
Speaker 1
You remember that only a few days ago you asked me my opinion on how the world would end. The scholarly scientist who is unwittingly perpetrated the horror on an unsuspecting world solemnly tells his young protege as they fly at 5000 feet in a light plain over the ever growing chicken heart. You remember my answer. Uh, such a scholarly prophecy. Mighty sounding theories about cessation of Earth, rotation, entropy, but now this is reality, Lewis. The end is come for humanity. Not in the red of atomic fusion, not in the glory of interstellar combustion. Not in the piece of white cold silence. But with that, that creeping, grasping flesh below us.
Speaker 12
It was a joke. Gay Lewis. The joke of the cosmos, the end of mankind because of a chicken heart.
Speaker 1
No Louis jibbers. No, I can&rsquo;t die. I&rsquo;ll find a safe landing place. But then, perfectly on cue, the comforting drone of a planes engine in the background becomes a coughing stutter. We&rsquo;re in a spin, Lewis screams.
Speaker 12
The end of all mankind.
Speaker 1
The doctor proclaims and stentorian tones and the two of them falled directly into the chicken heart. We hear it. Steady, beat louder, louder, and then the sickly splash that ends the play. Part of Obler&rsquo;s real genius was that when Chicken Heart ended, you felt like laughing and throwing up at the same time. Cue the bombers, an old radio bit used to run drone of bombers in the background. The minds eye visualises a sky black with flying forts. Dropped the ice cream into Puget Sound. The voice continues. Whining hydraulic sound of Bombay&rsquo;s opening a rising whistle followed by a gigantic splash. All right. Cue the chocolate syrup, the whipped cream. And drop the maraschino cherry. Is. We hear a great liquid squishing sound as the chocolate syrup goes, then a huge hissing as the whipped cream follows. These sounds are followed by a heavy plop, plop, plop in the background. And, absurd as it may be, the mind responds to these cues that interior eye actually sees a series of gigantic ice cream sundaes rising out of Puget Sound like strange volcanic. Stones, each with a maraschino cherry the size of Seattle&rsquo;s Kingdom. On top of it. In fact, we see those disgustingly red cocktail cherries raining down, plopping into all thou whipped cream and leaving craters nearly the size of great Tycho. Thank the genius of Stan Freberg. Arch Oboler A restlessly intelligent man who was also involved in. Movies 5 one of the first films to deal with the survival of Mankind after World War 3 was Obler&rsquo;s brainchild. And the legitimate theatre utilised 2 of radios. Great strengths. The first in the minds innate obedience, its willingness to try to see whatever someone suggests it see, no matter how absurd the second is, the fact that fear and horror are blinding emotions that knock our adult pins from beneath us. That leave us groping in the dark like children who cannot find the light. Radio is, of course, the blind medium, and only obler used it so well or so completely. Of course, our modern years pick up the necessary conventions of the medium that have been outgrown, mostly due to our growing dependence on the visual and our. Set of reality. But these were standard practises which audiences of the day had no trouble accepting. Like tornieri&rsquo;s paper mache, Rockwall and cat people. If these conventions seem jarring to listeners of the 80s, as the asides in a Shakespearean play seemed jarring to a novice playgoer, then that is our problem to work out as best we can. One of these conventions is the constant use of narration to move the story. A second is dialogue as description, a technique necessary to radio but one TV, and the movies have rendered obsolete. Here, for instance, from the chicken heart that ate the world is Doctor Albert&rsquo;s discussing the chicken heart itself with Louis. Read the passage and then ask yourself how true this speech rings to your TV and movie trained ears. Look at it down there. A great blanket of evil covering everything. See how the roads are black with men and women and their children fleeing for their lives. See how the protoplasmic grey reaches out and engulfs them. On TV, this would be laughed out of cord as total corn. It is not hip as they say. But heard in the darkness, coupled with the drone of the light planes engine in the background, it worked very well indeed. Willingly or unwillingly, the mind conjures up the image. Oboler wants this great Jelly like BLOB beating rhythmically, swallowing up the refugees as they run. Ironically, television in the early talkies both depended on the largely auditory conventions of radio. Until these, alright, we&rsquo;ll.
Craig
Post this that. Stephen King talking about why Chicken Heart works so well and how we really need to rewire ourselves to think about how. You know. Radio works as a theatre of the mind. How it doesn&rsquo;t draw upon the same types of suspension of disbelief that we&rsquo;ve become familiar with through TV and movies, where we want to visualise it. We want to see it. There&rsquo;s pleasure in the watching of it here. It&rsquo;s all in the minds eye and as king. Asks us when we listen to or read that last scene. That final scene of the scientists giving up hope and saying we&rsquo;re all doomed. And looking down at the pulsating, growing, fleshy heart. Again, he says, you know, this work to our TV is and his feeling is it&rsquo;s quite laughable. It wouldn&rsquo;t. So let&rsquo;s dive further into that idea of the theatre of the mind and how effectively it can work as kings setting out here. He&rsquo;s saying it&rsquo;s a really significant moment. To imagine through your mind&rsquo;s eye the theatre of the mind, which really. Is able to do. By listening to one of the other important cultural effects that chicken heart had on pop culture, and this is Bill Cosby&rsquo;s famous 1966 album Wonderfulness. Which was part of one of his. Live comedy acts and this is his famous discussion of chicken hearts. Of course, Bill Cosby famous. For you know. Fat, Alberts, Cosby, kids and so forth, and equally probably more infamous now for his criminal activities. And law cases against him and being found guilty of rape, SO1 can&rsquo;t unpack that from what we&rsquo;re about to hear, important to say, of course, and deeply problematic individual. People. But let&rsquo;s listen to this famous comedy routine he has, which I do think speaks to Stephen King&rsquo;s point around trying to understand how theatre of the mind works and how effective Arch Ogler was with chicken hearts at creating this. So let&rsquo;s listen now to a a little bit from the sketch. From the 1966 album Wonderfulness by Bill Cosby.
Speaker 11
Go ahead, scare me to. I&rsquo;m ready. I&rsquo;m ready. Scare me, man. Come on now. And welcome to. Lights. Ohh yeah, yeah, yeah, go ahead. Scare me. I was dumb enough to do whatever the guy said to do on the radio. Turn your lights off. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. To round, go on, scare me to death. I&rsquo;m ready. Tonight&rsquo;s episode is about a chicken heart. A chicken heart that ate up New York City. Yeah, go chicken heart. Go, go get him. Eat him up. Chicken heart scare me to death. I&rsquo;m. I&rsquo;m ready. I&rsquo;m ready. The Chicken heart was kept alive. 5. In a laboratory and of that special solution, half blood, half sodium solution, right? One day a careless janitor. Knock that over, he went to get away to clean it up. The chicken heart grew. 6 foot 5 inches and in search. Of human blood. The janitor came back, opened the door. Them up.
Speaker 9
What?
Speaker 11
Go get him chicken high. Go get him. Go get him. It moved out into the hallway, rang for the elevator.
Speaker 13
4th floor.
Speaker 11
Go get him chicken high. Go get him. You will. Moved out into the street. Ate up all the cabs. The Empire State Building. Ate up their jersey Turnpike. It&rsquo;s in your home state. It&rsquo;s outside of your door. And it&rsquo;s going to eat you up.
Speaker 13
Ohh, got my jello star spirited all over the floor. I set the sofa on fire. You won&rsquo;t come there smoking fire and jello. My father came in the house and what? 1000 sober doing on fire coming out of the chicken was gonna eat. OK, zip. What chicken are you talking about? Who went on the radio show? You the idiot. Turn it off.
Speaker 11
I hadn&rsquo;t thought of that. For two years, anybody that passed by our House.
Speaker 14
Hmm. My father, whether he knew him or not, would call him in. Hey, come on. I want to. Show you my dumb kid. Ohh and tell him you burn up $100 sofa and broke your father&rsquo;s arm. Save us from that.
Craig
So that&rsquo;s the classic 1966 Bill Cosby routine. Chicken hearts again, I think really putting you in the feeling of listening to that live. With a panic that can trigger into ones imagination. And of course, what&rsquo;s interesting here is, you know Bill Cosby. Acknowledging the again talking about how Stuart Hall would talk about the reading positions here, you&rsquo;ve got the dominant reading position of Chicken Heart, which is it&rsquo;s a really good Horror Story, right? It has this good escalating horror that&rsquo;s going to it, which interestingly, Bill Cosby sets up and in a really kind of fan fiction way. Actually embellishes and explains how the hearts started to grow. That a janitor accidentally knocked over some chemical the chemical got into the heart and just caused this unlikely growth of the heart that the scientists had had had kept alive. So one that you have the dominant reading, but then? You have, you know, Bill. Cosby, which is kind of doing his own, it&rsquo;s a. Version of that. For comedy effect, talking about, you know, if you if you took it literally, it suddenly becomes insane. It says it&rsquo;s weird that you would believe this suddenly. So much so that you&rsquo;d set. Lie to you&rsquo;re so fit to protect yourself, and again the whole absurdity of listening to the. Escalating horror that you you you&rsquo;re only listening to radio show yet it seems so real. It seems like it&rsquo;s happening so much like a year later. From this you&rsquo;ll have awesome wells or the world&rsquo;s broadcast, which notoriously led to people arming themselves, getting out of their homes to try to defend their communities. That that they. Were seeing this as real equally here for comedy Effect, Bill Cosby&rsquo;s comic retelling of it being that kind. Of you know. It&rsquo;s looking at it on paper, as Stephen King says, it&rsquo;s. Kind of laughable. How can this chicken heart be so terrifying? That is absurd. Yet it is this masterful, I think, combination of of of you know, comic, horror and and kind of over identifying with the fear as a Zizek, Zizek the philosopher. Would talk about this, this, this kind of humour that occurs with extreme. Year where the terror is so ratchet it up that it gets to a point of absurdity which you know is, I think, the heart of Bill Cosby&rsquo;s comedy routine there and and and also. Yeah. Obviously some listeners have have have registered that. Thanks Anna for smashing in. I&rsquo;m glad it was fun to listen to that on the way home in the car. Because yeah, I think it does hold up 1937. This broadcast was first made, but it&rsquo;s such an effective bit of. Of horror that it&rsquo;s. Worthy of of unpacking it and also looking at the cultural impact it&rsquo;s had, Steven. Being fantastic, one of the best horror authors, as well as Bill Cosby, turning it both into a bit of cultural touchstone to discuss. You know, Bill Cosby&rsquo;s 1966 community and dance macabre. What came out in the early 80s. So there you&rsquo;re looking at 20 year periods where this. Cultural touchstone of the 1937 radio drama You know still gets discussed and talked about. The other thing that&rsquo;s so interesting I think about.
Speaker
Yes.
Craig
The chicken heart is this idea of, you know, the the absurd logic of it, that the system that you see that&rsquo;s occurring around the chicken hearts, you know that, you know, the science system, the military system, the police system, the journalism system. All it does is kind of reinforces what they&rsquo;re trying to stop, right? So they&rsquo;re all trying to stop the growth of the chicken hearts. And again, this is what Zizek says is so powerful about horror stories that often they&rsquo;re these tales. Of trying to stop the threats and particularly where the story is, you know, the darks tea time of the soul, the kind of, you know, and we lose, it&rsquo;s about the system itself being broken, that the system itself is trying to stop the threat. But the more it tries to stop the threat, the worse the threat. That&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s bringing more amplification to the threat. And this is Isaac. &lsquo;S theory of how he sees. Some abuses of power occurring, some kind of logics of of of ideology, that are growing exponentially and out of control, that the system might have begun with good intentions, but as it&rsquo;s released some destructive force, the more that the system tries to stop that destruction. It in so. Amplifies it. So again, interesting kind of resonances. I think with Trump&rsquo;s response to California today, right? How is it that the system, you know, claims of trying to stop violence yet still escalate violence? Right. So this logic, this paradox between. Just like the chicken heart, the expanding Organism. Which is paradoxically, being accelerated by its growth as. More bombing is occurring. More attempts to destroy it is happening, so there&rsquo;s some really interesting philosophical questions that are occurring there as well as, as you know, Stephen King&rsquo;s pointing out a really master class in how to create a story in 7 1/2 minutes. That is about the escalation of horror, the escalation of terror that works so effectively in radio. So it&rsquo;s worth, you know if you&rsquo;ve got a bit of time going back listening to lights out, a great 1930s forties radio serial drama. We&rsquo;ve talked about other great moments in horror radio dramas like the thing on the FOURBLE board, which is more of a psychological horror. Chicken heart is pretty much. A fantastic example of more of your minimalist horror where the sound effects do all the heavy lifting for the for the panic, whereas the thing on the fourble board which is considered to be another great horror radio drama, really escalates that through this eerie narration. As the characters interact, listen back to our episode on. The thing on the forward board for more discussion on that. But yeah, we&rsquo;ll. Dip into some more radio drama and piece together why it still matters in future shows. Again, I hope you thought the chicken heart was a nice bit of timeless horror, and in particular, listen back to it. Think of how sound based. Fear works, and if it&rsquo;s still effective today as it was in 1937, turn those lights out and listen to it. And see if, umm, you know a true experience of horror isn&rsquo;t just about monsters, but maybe about our inability to control the unknown. So that&rsquo;s medium other for another week, we&rsquo;ll be taking a break next week as they do a little bit of field research up in Launceston to bring some new interesting. Freeze to the airwaves in a fortnight time so no show. Next Thursday the 19th of June. Thanks everyone for listening to me and mother shipments. Radio. You can listen back to other audio notes for the show on your podcast supplier of choice. As well as catch visuals of the show on YouTube and Twitch, keep listening now to some really cool edge radio tunes.

<h5 class="wp-block-heading" id="viewer-viewer-viewer-7f6l">Episode 102 &ndash; With host Craig Norris and Taylor Lidstone</h5>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading" id="viewer-viewer-viewer-a1qg9">First Broadcast on <a href="https://www.edgeradio.org.au/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Edge Radio</a>, 11 April 2025.</h5>



<p id="6awsr20328">Join us as we delve into the latest trends in media culture and spotlight a classic gem from the golden age of radio&mdash;&rsquo;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHkhMMKF3LQ&amp;t=329s">Nothing Behind the Door</a>&lsquo; (1947) from the <em>Quiet, Please</em> series. We analyze its storytelling beats using Blake Snyder&rsquo;s Save the Cat theory, uncovering what makes this episode a timeless piece of eerie radio drama. Inspired by the release of Black Mirror Season 7, we explore the roots of surreal, grim, and haunting narratives found in classic radio shows.</p>
